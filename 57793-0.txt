                                PREFACE.


In consenting to write the history of the organization, and the marches,
skirmishes, battles and deeds of our brave old regiment, at this late
date, is, I know, accepting an undertaking from which anyone might well
shrink; and yet to preserve on record the dear old story, the task has
been cheerfully attempted.

It is not expected that this book will be of interest to the general
reader; to those only who participated in, or followed with loving eyes,
its fortunes, will the dry details, which must necessarily often enter
into its composition, be interesting, and without apology to the
officers and men, of the 123d Ohio Volunteer Infantry, this book is
offered as a true record of their soldier life.

                                                            C. M. KEYES.

 SANDUSKY, OHIO, July, 1874.




                              DEDICATION.


To the noble dead of our old battle-worn regiment, whether sleeping in
unknown graves, on southern battlefields, or by the dark prison pens,
where only the sighing pines may chaunt their requiem, or it may be in
the quiet churchyards of our own bright northland, to their widows and
orphans who mourn in sorrow for their bright noble ones who will never
more return; to the maimed and crippled ones, limping throughout the
land, their heroism saved, these pages are sacredly dedicated.

                                                                 AUTHOR.

The 123d Regiment was organized under the second call for six hundred
thousand troops, and was recruited during the months of August and
September, 1862, in the counties of Erie, Huron, Seneca, Crawford and
Wyandotte, and was rendezvoused at Monroeville, Huron county, Ohio; some
companies arriving late in August, while all were in camp early in
September. Gen. J. A. Jones was post commander, and assigned companies
to their quarters as they arrived, saw that they were properly
subsisted, &c. All the companies, except K, were mustered into the
United States Service by Capt. E. W. H. Read of the 8th U. S. Infantry,
on the 24th and 29th days of September; company K was mustered in by
Capt. Chas. C. Goddard of the 17th Infantry, on the 16th of October, the

Company G was recruited in Erie county by Capt. Charles H. Riggs, with
headquarters at Sandusky; the majority of the company were from Sandusky
city, and the townships adjoining, all parts of the county, however,

August 8th, and on the 22d of the same month the company was full, and
soon after went into camp at Monroeville, and was mustered into the

The foregoing rosters are correct copies of the original Muster-In-Rolls
of the various companies.

As a matter of course they do not show the recruits who came to the
regiment in 1863 and 1864. Their names, however, will appear in the
chapter devoted to the “muster-out.” Nearly two hundred recruits came to
the regiment to fill its depleted ranks, and many of them were the very
best of soldiers.

Only three of whom, Col. W. T. Wilson, Assistant Surgeon W. B. Hyatt and
Quarter Master Edwin H. Brown, served through with the regiment until
the close of the war. Major A. B. Norton resigned his commission soon
after the regiment went to the field Assistant Surgeon J. H. Williams
resigned during the Summer of 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel Henry B. Hunter served in the Valley Campaign of
1863, was captured at Winchester June 15th, remained in prison about ten
months, which so broke down his health that soon after he was exchanged,
not being fit for duty in the field, he tendered his resignation, and
was mustered out of the service. Surgeon Orrin Ferris served with the
regiment until the close of the campaign of 1864, when, with shattered
constitution, and sadly impaired health, much against his own
inclination and the wishes of the entire regiment, his resignation was
tendered and accepted.

                              CHAPTER II.
    CAMP LIFE AT MONROEVILLE—REMOVAL TO THE SEAT OF WAR—MARCHES AND
           EXPERIENCES OF THE REGIMENT UP TO JUNE 12TH, 1863.


Our life here was one continued round of excitement, and all were glad
when the order came, (October 16,) for the regiment to move. A large
number of friends were there to say good bye, and amid the tears and the
God bless you of the multitude, we started for untried scenes in the
great war of the rebellion.

Not, perhaps, in the course of the whole war, did Ohio send to the field
a regiment of men whose whole souls were in the cause so firmly, and
whose faith in the perpetuation of this glorious government of ours, was
so pure, as the gallant One Hundred and Twenty-third. With officers,
both in the field and line, who were not only brave and competent, but
gentlemen on all occasions; with men whose efficiency and bravery, yet
untested, but afterward so sorely tried, and never found lacking, it was
no wonder that in the years that followed, the regiment was often
selected to perform duties requiring both courage and discipline,
secresy and dispatch.

To Zanesville by rail, and then down the Muskingum river, on transports
to Parkersburg, stopping at several places on the river, some of which,
and McConnelsville in particular, no doubt remembered our visit for some
time.

On the 19th, we left on board of box cars, in two trains, for
Clarksburg, on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. On the way a man
belonging to Company H was severely injured, and just after having
passed through a tunnel, the rear train ran into the one just ahead of
it. Three cars were thrown from the track, and down an embankment, yet
strange to say, none were very seriously injured, though all were pretty
severely shook up. The engineer and conductor were strongly threatened
by the boys, who believed them rebels at heart, and that the accident
was a put-up affair. However, matters were at length quieted, and soon
we were on our way for Clarksburg, where we arrived on the 20th, and
went into camp. Here we received Sibley tents, five to a company, and
two wall tents for the officers of each company. We thought them
anything but extra residences, but before the war was over a new “dog
tent” was counted a palace. Nothing of interest occured here, and on the
27th none were sorry when we received orders to break camp and proceed
to Buckhannon, distance 27 miles. This, our first day’s march, was
through the worst mud we ever saw, and over a road which only a Western
Virginian can appreciate. Afterward we laughed about this march, and
would have considered it a little pleasure jaunt, but at that time, to
us, those eleven miles seemed a hundred. We reached Buckhannon on the
morning of the 29th, and remained there in camp—resting—until November
2d, when away we went toward Beverly, thirty-one miles distant. The
first night out we camped at the Middle Fork of Tygart Valley river,
eleven miles from our start of the morning. On the bridge that spans the
creek at this point we found cut in the wood the familiar names of
friends in Company E, 8th Ohio, who had gone this way before us.

It was here the boys of Company G cared so well for the teamster of a
runaway team, with the wagon of the medical purveyor, laden with wines
and whisky, and at the same time captured all the bottles with corks
out, or that could be pulled out. However, in the morning not a vestige
of a cork or bottle could be found about Company G’s quarters.

The next day we marched eighteen miles, reaching Beverly. On the way we
passed the Rich Mountain battle ground, the engagement at this place,
near a year previous, having been so called up to that time, but the big
events that followed soon after our visit, caused it to take rank as a
skirmish only. It will be remembered that it was here that the 87th
Pennsylvania attempted to force the guard, and thus roam through the
village at will; but finding that two batteries were rapidly wheeled
into position, and the balance of the brigade ready to fire on them,
finally carried off their two comrades whom the guard had shot down for
attempting to pass, and sullenly retired to their camp. We remained here
“resting up” until the 7th, marching that day to Huttonville, eleven
miles distant, and sure enough, it was a village of Huts, and of a very
few huts at that. We had a rather cold rainy time of it here, and a good
many of the boys were taken sick and sent back to Beverly.

While lying at Huttonville, Lieutenant Randolph, of Company B, was sent
out forty miles to call in a command that was on the road towards
Staunton. Procuring a good horse, he started alone, armed only with a
sabre and revolver, and carried the order through the enemy’s country
and returned safely to his command. We were all glad to see him back,
for it was an undertaking fraught with dangers at every turn—besides, if
taken prisoner, the chances of being treated as a spy stared him in the
face.

We remained here until November 15th, when we returned to Beverly, and
encamped for the night on a level plat of ground just east of the town.

Not soon will Mrs. Arnold, a Union lady, although the only sister of
Stonewall Jackson, and residing at this place, be forgotten by the men
of the 123d Regiment. Taking as many of our sick as she possibly could
into her own house, she nursed them through their sickness as only a
loving mother could—two of them she nursed through a long attack of
typhoid fever, and that, too, after the surgeon in charge had pronounced
them hopeless, and to her loving care and watchful tenderness do these
two boys yet live, owing her their lives.

We received company wagons here, and on the 16th, started for Webster,
fifty-four miles distant, arriving there on the 18th. On the route we
passed over Laurel Hill, where many a root was dug for the pipe, with
which to cheer our lonely hours, and passed the scene of the battle of
Phillippi, one of the most considerable fights of West Virginia. The
grand scenery along the route of this entire march made the trip worth
the taking, for that, if nothing more, and surely none of us could see
for what other purpose our journeyings of the past two weeks could
possibly be, unless it was as the boys invariably would answer,
“military strategy, my boy,” though the wisdom of this sort of thing we
learned soon to distrust. From Webster we took the cars for New Creek,
arriving there on the 19th. On the 22d we had our first grand review by
General Robt. Milroy, accompanied by General Cluseret, who has since
figured conspicuously in the late French war. We remained at New Creek
until December 12th, and during which time, besides being vaccinated
pretty thoroughly, were brigaded and re-brigaded a number of times,
finally forming a part of Col. Washburn’s brigade, with which command we
moved out to Burlington, thirteen miles distant, and remained there
awaiting orders.

Up to this time, we had scarcely realized that we were in reality men of
war—true, we had made some hard marches, and camped out in the snow and
rain, after plodding along all day through slush and mud; but as yet we
had not met the sterner realities belonging and incidental to a
soldier’s life; it seemed more like a picnic excursion, without any
definite object or end; later we gave more thought to the situation, and
study to the chances of war.

On the morning of the 17th we again broke camp, and on the afternoon of
the 18th arrived at Petersburg, a small hamlet forty-two miles from New
Creek. We, in a general way, now understood that a force of rebels were
near, and great caution was observed on the picket line, and very little
wandering from camp was indulged in by the men. And to see how alert the
camp was, on the afternoon of the 19th the long roll was sounded, our
regiment getting into line in six minutes. That night we slept upon our
arms for the first time, at a later day a very ordinary occurrence. On
the 28th, the 116th O. V. I., and one section of the 1st Virginia
battery left for Moorefield, about eleven miles distant, and took
possession of the town. We remained here until January 3d. At nine
o’clock in the morning, orders were received to break camp at once;
tents were struck, wagons loaded, and started for New Creek, and by
quarter past ten we were on the way to Moorefield. Soon after starting,
the firing of cannon was heard, satisfying us that there was business
ahead. Never did the regiment march better; those eleven miles were
passed over in two hours and ten minutes. Reaching the river bank, Co. A
was sent down the left bank of the river, and Cos. B and G were ordered
across to feel of the enemy, who had surrounded the 116th on a hill near
the town. Shots from a rebel battery on the hill beyond soon sent them
back to the river bank, where they had orders to remain and await the
return of scouts, who had been sent out to reach the camp of the 116th,
if possible. All this time a continued firing was kept up from a section
of our artillery, which must have done good execution, for the enemy did
not long reply. Before night we joined the 116th, the rebels having
withdrawn their forces.

The morning was very bright and pleasant, but by night the winds swept
cold and bleak down the valley, and we passed about as disagreeable a
night as at any time during the war, for it will be remembered that our
wagon train was sent back to New Creek with all our cooking utensils,
provision and much of our heavier clothing; and though the 116th Ohio
did all they could for our comfort, still our condition was anything but
comfortable.

On the 4th, a brigade came up under command of General Mulligan, who now
assumed command of all the troops. The night again set in cold and
blustering, and as none of us had blankets, a cool prospect was in view.
Skirmishing began early for a bundle of hay or straw for covering, and
all prepared to make the best of the situation. Two smart chaps from Co.
G crawled into a wagon box, with their little bundle of hay to pass the
night, and were soon in the land of dreams, but their comfort was of
short duration, for a stray mule, wandering that way, proceeded to help
himself from their covering, and did not desist so long as a straw
remained. The increased cold soon waked the boys up, and after
expressing their feelings in a very forcible manner, sought other
quarters in which to pass the remainder of the night.

At half past one, on the morning of January 6th, five companies of the
123d, and five companies of the 116th, with Mulligan’s Brigade, started
out to attack a camp of Rebels, distant nine miles, but after marching
to near the point designated, found that they had left in a great hurry
for a more southern clime; returning to camp, we arrived there at 3
o’clock A. M., having marched eighteen miles—a long walk before
breakfast. It was on this march that Gen. Mulligan compelled the men to
throw down captured chickens and turkeys, which otherwise would have
made many a good breakfast on our arrival in camp it is needless to say,
that this sort of fooling was not indulged in to any extent in later
years. It was on this occasion, that the incident happened, which Col.
Wilson is so fond of relating, and which always provokes a hearty laugh
from listeners, especially those who remember old Capt. Newman, of
Company H, who when asked how he came to set such an example before his
men, as to capture a turkey, with the evident intention of taking it
into camp, remarked that the “Tam durkey coom’d a runnin out of the gate
mit his mouth vide open, and Colonel, you don’t tink I is goin to let a
tam durkey bite me? no sir!” As a matter of course a reprimand was not
administered. The next day a part of the Regiment went out foraging for
grain; and in the afternoon, firing being heard in the direction taken
by them, reinforcements were sent out to their assistance; but they soon
met the boys coming in all right, with their wagons loaded principally
with grain; but chickens, potatoes, onions, &c., entered largely into
the cargo, and a pretty good supper was the result.

It will be remembered that one night while here, our regiment was
quartered in the Court House, whereupon some good citizens, loyal to the
Southern cause, went to Gen. Mulligan and asked that the desecration be
no longer allowed; orders were immediately issued that we should vacate
at once, which of course we did, but in no very amiable mood; for the
ground was covered with snow, and as yet we had not received our
blankets. The matting however that the aisles were carpeted with, was
all cut into strips and carried with us, and used for bedding as long as
we remained there.

On the 9th of January we received orders to march to Romney, but delayed
starting until the next day, camping at night eighteen miles from
Moorefield, passing the dwelling house of the guerilla chief, Capt.
McNiel, and for the first time, at least many of us, saw regular
Southern Slave quarters. The next day at 3 o’clock in the afternoon we
arrived in Romney, which we found in a very dilapidated condition.

It soon became apparent that we were to remain here all winter, and all
tried to fix up in as comfortable shape as possible, but a more
cheerless spot to spend the winter in could hardly have been selected,
as the winds had a fair sweep in three different directions, and as a
general thing improved the opportunity in one direction or the other,
much to our discomfort and disgust. Our life here was one continual
round of picket duty or foraging. Very seldom did anything occur to
break the usual monotony. However on the 16th of February five teams
from our regiment and fourteen from the 116th Ohio Regiment, under
escort of Company F, 116th, Capt. Brown commanding, went towards
Moorefield, foraging for hay, and on their return, when within about six
miles of Romney, were captured by the guerilla, Capt. McNiel, with
twenty-six men, owing to the bad management of Capt. Brown, who allowed
his men to straggle all over the country, so that not more than three or
four of them were together at any one time, which made their capture a
very easy matter.

Capt. Brown was subsequently court-martialed, and found guilty of basely
deserting his command in the face of the enemy. Our men were well
treated by Capt. McNiel, who gave them money to buy their dinner, and
taking their parole, sent them back to camp. The next morning Col.
Washburn, of 116 O. V. I., commanding Brigade, called upon the 123d for
a company to go out to the scene of the capture and bring in anything
they might find. Capt. Horace Kellogg’s Company was soon in readiness
and on the move. They found five wagons all sound, but the others were
all burned, nothing but the irons and a heap of ashes left where each
wagon had stood. The company returned to camp without accident, with the
exception of accidentally shooting several of the domestic feathered
family, which carelessly strayed across the road. Our regiment was now
encamped upon the ground occupied by the 55th O. V. I. while encamped
here one year previous. The boys planted evergreens along their company
streets and about company headquarters, making our camp look very
pleasant and homelike. While lying here company officers were ordered
before a military board of examiners to test their military tactics,
drill, &c. There was considerable uneasiness manifested by some, but as
it appeared afterwards, without cause, for the board, for some unknown
reason never convened, and thus the troublesome ordeal never was passed,
though several of our officers concluded that they had experienced about
all the soldiering they cared for and tendered their resignations which
were accepted, and some promotions were made as the necessary result. We
had very little opportunity for drill, as it was usually very muddy, and
so the winter wore monotonously away, relieved now and then by the
receiving of boxes from our friends at home, and, though we did not
materially need their contents, still this evidence that we were warmly
remembered by the dear ones at home, gave us renewed zeal in the work we
had so cheerfully volunteered to do. Some of our officers’ wives visited
us while here, and though many of us did not even know them, their
cheerful smiles and kind words warmed the hearts of many a homesick boy,
and created within our breasts a firm determination to do all that lay
in our power to preserve inviolate the homes of the noble women whom we
had left behind.

Never shall be forgotten with what avidity we devoured the contents of
our letters from home, and how sorrowingly we would turn away when the
unwelcome intelligence was announced, “no letters to-day.” This anxiety
for news from home may seem a little strange, but when it is remembered
that many of the boys were away from home for the first time and with no
very certain hope of ever again returning, it is not to be wondered at.

We were all ready for the order to move when it came, March 14th, 1863,
for we were thoroughly tired of lying here doing nothing, and all were
anxious to engage in the real business of war. On the morning of the
15th we started towards Winchester and marched twenty-one miles,
encamping just east of Blue Gap. While passing through the Gap a
terrific thunder storm burst upon us, the rain falling in perfect
sheets, drenching us to the skin. It was certainly a wild and beautiful
sight, the mountains rising on either side to a considerable heights,
the lightening flashing, as it appeared, from crag to crag, the thunder
reverberating down the sides of clifts, caused a feeling of awe to creep
over every heart; but the sun soon burst out in all its splendor, and
dispelled the gloom as with a magicians wand. It was here we received
the order that only the top rail of the fences should be taken for fire
wood; of course the order was construed that we shouldn’t take the
bottom one, and was therefore strictly carried out. We encamped near a
meadow and the stacks of hay still standing in the field were chiefly
converted into fodder for the horses, and bedding for the boys. Very
soon the camp-kettles were steaming and supper prepared, after which all
lay down and enjoyed a refreshing sleep, such as those only can
appreciate who have been similarly situated. The next day we were on the
march bright and early, encamping at night at Hayfield Church, fourteen
miles from the start of the morning, on the finest ground we had yet
occupied as a camp, and near several springs of clear, cold water. We
arrived in Winchester the next day, March 17th, and went into camp on
the hill near the old fort, where we remained for several days, finally
changing to a park near the Rebel burying ground, a splendid camping
ground, which the boys fully appreciated.

On the 4th of April we had Division Review, our regiment being second
best as to general condition and drill.

April 22d, we went on a scout up the valley as far as Strasburg, our
cavalry having a little tilt with the enemy, but nothing decisive
resulted. On the next day we returned to Winchester with thirty
prisoners. On the 25th we again started up the valley, the next day
arriving at Wardonsville, distant thirty-one miles. On the way we passed
the celebrated Capon Springs, a beautiful place, reopened since the war.

On the morrow we marched to Lost River, and finding the bridge gone, we
returned to our camp of the night previous. On the route we passed some
of the wildest and most beautiful scenery that West Virginia can boast
of. On the 27th we again started for Moorefield, with arrangements for
crossing the river, but when nine miles out received orders to return,
and went into camp at Wardonsville for the third time. The next day we
marched to Strasburg, where the 13th Pennsylvania cavalry was led into
an ambush, losing several men in killed and wounded. The Rebels,
however, were driven out, though no general engagement occured. The next
day we returned to Winchester, having marched ninety-four miles, and
that too without having accomplished any particular end as we could see.
When in camp we were drilling steadily seven hours a day, gaining in
proficiency in the arts of war every day, and fitting ourselves to
undergo the fatigue and hardships that we were soon to be called upon to
endure.

We did a large amount of hard work while in the valley, up to June 12th;
long scouts up the valley were a weekly occurrence, and heavy picket and
fatigue duty was the daily order of exercise, still, thanks to the
excellent water and fine weather, the health of the regiment was in the
main good. On the 5th of May, we started out with a week’s rations and
forty rounds, on a scout. The first day out we marched for three hours
through a drenching rain-storm, such as only occurs in the valleys, we
went to New Market, and returned to Winchester on the 9th, having
marched one hundred and four miles. We saw a few miserable bushwhackers,
but nothing that would indicate any rebel force.

It was soon after this trip that the entire regiment went out on road
work, making four miles of McAdamized road in three days.

Soon after our arrival at Winchester, our Adjutant, W. V. McCracken, and
1st Lieutenant Hugh L. McKee, of company D, were detailed on Gen.
Milroy’s staff, where the former served until after the battle of
Winchester, and the latter was promoted to Captain and Assistant
Quarter-Master, and never again returned to the regiment. On the 9th of
June, Lieut. Gillam of company F died of typhoid fever. He had been sick
for a long time, and had every attention and care, his wife being with
him nearly all the time.

On the afternoon of June 12th the Long Roll sounded and the regiment
with the 116th Ohio Infantry, 12th Virginia, and Battery D, and a
regiment of cavalry started out on the valley pike. When beyond
Kearnstown we met the enemy in considerable force, and drawing them into
an enfilading fire, gave them so warm a reception that they started up
the valley faster than they had come down. We captured a good many
prisoners, and after night fall, we returned to camp—satisfied that the
next day would bring, as the boys termed it, “business,” and, as events
proved, their conjectures were well founded.




                              CHAPTER III.
ACCOUNT OF THE ENGAGEMENT AT WINCHESTER, JUNE 13TH, 14TH AND 15TH, 1863.


June 13th dawned clear and bright on the Valley City, the quiet hush of
morning gave little indication of the scene of carnage so soon to be
enacted. About 9 o’clock in the morning the long roll sounded to arms,
and soon the regiment was in line awaiting orders. Soon they came and we
were rapidly moved up the pike to Kearnstown, where after having
deployed a heavy line of skirmishers, the regiment was halted and
remained until about 2 o’clock P. M., when rapidly drawing in our
skirmishers, we fell back a short distance and took up a position west
of the pike. While crossing the pike the enemy opened a sharp fire upon
us, and several men were killed or wounded, but the regiment behaved
splendidly, taking their position as coolly as veterans, though under
fire, as you might say for the first time. Volley after volley was now
poured into the enemies ranks, which must have done good execution, as
their fire very sensibly slackened. We again changed position to a
slight eminence a few rods in the rear, where the regiment remained
firm, receiving and returning the enemy’s fire as calmly as though drawn
up on dress parade until night drew her curtains about us and put an end
to the carnage. Our lines were now drawn close around the city, our
regiment remaining in line until long after midnight, when we were
relieved and allowed a few hours for rest. In this day’s fight the
regiment’s loss was seventy-six men in killed and wounded. The men acted
grandly, receiving praise for their gallant conduct from Gen. Milroy in
person.

The next morning we were ordered into the fort where we remained until
evening, when we were ordered to make a sortie, but were driven back,
the enemy having captured one of our outer posts, and turned their guns
upon us.

Our forces now all rallied upon the main fort where the enemy charged
us, but they were easily repulsed, and they did not again make the
attempt.

All were now confidant that our position was no longer tenable, the
Rebels being largely superior in numbers and rapidly concentrating more
troops in our vicinity; a council of war was held, when it was decided
to make the attempt to cut our way through to Harper’s Ferry if
possible. About 2 o’clock in the morning the movement began; the column
moved out on the Martinsburg pike. Our regiment having the advance, all
went well until we had put about five miles between us and Winchester,
and were congratulating ourselves on getting out so nicely, when all at
once our advance guard struck the enemy, who had marched around and got
in our rear during the night.

Our regiment and the 87th Pennsylvania were rapidly got into position,
and immediately charged the Rebels, who were drawn up in a wood just to
the right of the road, capturing their artillery, but were unable to
hold them against the murderous fire now poured into our ranks, and
sullenly retired for a short distance. Two other regiments were now
hurried into position, when we again moved to the charge. In steady and
firm line we now advanced, and, though, grape and canister ploughed
great lanes through our poor ranks, not a man faltered or turned back;
but the gallant old regiment was leaving its track marked with its dead
and its dying. Once more their guns were ours, again their deadly fire
forced our now sadly weakened lines slowly back, but only a few rods,
when once more a strong line was formed and our boys stood grim and firm
awaiting the next move. It will be remembered that all this fighting was
done in the darkness, though the gray of morning began faintly to light
up the scene as the regiment retired from this charge. The terrific
picture presented in that wood we shall not soon forget; the flashes of
musketry in the darkness, casting a sickly glare all around; the roar of
artillery, the crashing of grape shot through the brush; the cheers of
the charging troops, and cries of the dying left an impress that will
remain vivid in our memories while time with us remains.

Not long were we held inactive; for the third time, over the same
ground, did our gallant little band make their way, and though greatly
weakened in numbers, with unfaltering step, and shoulder to shoulder,
the dangerous distance was again traversed, but only to repeat the
sickening details of the first and second charges. On retiring from this
last assault we fell slowly back out of the range of their guns,
repulsed—sadly stricken, yet still undaunted, for by this time we, of
course, supposed that the entire army would be on the ground and in
shape for action. That we were whipped we had not the remotest idea, and
when a white flag was hoisted—as we afterwards learned—by the orders of
Col. Ely of the 18th Connecticut, who was left in command, all were
completely taken aback, for there was not the slightest doubt but that
we could have got away as easily as not; however we had to submit and
surrendered three hundred and one men and twenty-one commissioned
officers.

Throughout these three days of bloody baptism, the men and officers
behaved in the most gallant manner. In the storm of grape and canister
Col. Wilson, Lieut.-Col. Hunter and Maj. Horace Kellogg, rode their
horses as coolly as though it were simply a hail storm, which,
undoubtedly, contributed greatly in keeping the regiment so firmly to
the work.

In making the second charge Major Kellogg was severely wounded, and
retired soon after from the field and succeeded in making his escape
into Maryland, where those of the regiment who made their escape were
subsequently collected together. Company D, Capt. Shawhan commanding,
being on provost duty, were in charge of the prisoners, and of course
did not participate in the fight, which was not only fortunate for them,
but for the regiment also, as otherwise there would have been no nucleus
around which to gather. In this engagement our loss was fifty-one men in
killed and wounded, and three officers wounded, one of whom, Capt.
Bender of company I, afterwards died in prison. We afterwards learned
that, while our regiment together with four others, was making this
desperate fight, the rest of our forces flanked the enemy and pushed
right on to Harper’s Ferry, leaving us to our fate; perhaps it was for
the best, but, from our stand-point, we failed to see the beauty of the
strategy.

We were taken back to Winchester about noon, preparatory to being sent
in to Dixie, which was soon after done.




                              CHAPTER IV.
 HISTORY OF REGIMENT FROM JUNE 15TH, 1863, TO MAY 18TH, 1864, INCLUDING
                     THE ENGAGEMENT AT NEW MARKET.


So large a portion of the regiment being now captured, we propose to
follow their fortunes into Rebeldom as a regiment. Company D acting as
provost guard to Gen. Milroy, went out with the balance of the army,
doing guard duty at various points until the regiment was again
organized, as will subsequently appear. After the surrender of the
forces by Col. Ely, as narrated, the men of the 123d were marched into
the fort at Winchester, and there confined until such time as the Rebels
could make it convenient to take them to their future prison.

Now, indeed, did the situation seem anything but cheerful; the Rebel
army had passed north, and as we supposed, were marching about
unopposed, over the States of Maryland and Pennsylvania. They had made
their boasts that some of the great cities of the North should taste the
horrors of war, and we did not know but at that moment Lee’s hordes
might be running riot through the streets of Philadelphia. The cause of
the Union, the cause for which we had suffered, seemed at a low ebb. It
will be remembered that we were now passing through a phase of life
entirely different from anything heretofore experienced. Very few of us
had ever been in duress for a single instant; and thus to be deprived of
our liberties, to become the creatures of another’s will, it is not
surprising that our faith for a time weakened, and the darkness of
despair seemed well nigh upon us. We, however, were treated with some
degree of humanity by the Rebels, and received many proofs that there
were some good and true Union people living in Winchester, for which
they, one year later, received satisfactory and substantial tokens of
our esteem.

On the afternoon of the 16th, the men were started on their long journey
to Richmond, arriving at Staunton on the 22d, distant ninety miles. Here
we took the cars for Richmond, arriving there on the 23d. It seemed as
though the entire Rebel capitol had turned out to see the Yankees, and
would hoot and hiss at us as we passed along. The officers took up their
quarters at Hotel-de-Libby; the men were furnished accommodations on
“Belle-Isle,” which by the way was nothing more nor less than a large
sand bank, with a few trees upon it, situated near the south bank of the
James River. We were closely guarded, not even allowed the privilege of
buying one of their own papers, though we managed to get one now and
then from the guards. It is needless to recount our sufferings here, as
no pen can do adequate justice to the subject. I will only say that the
meat and soup were full of maggots, and the bread so stale and sour as
to be almost unpalatable, these constituting our eatables, while the
water we drank was even worse.

On the 6th of July the majority of the men were paroled, and were taken
to City Point, by rail, _via_ Petersburg, and delivered to the United
States authorities. Never were the Stars and Stripes more
enthusiastically cheered, than when we first saw them streaming from the
Flag of the Truce boat; once on board we had plenty to eat, and soon all
were in high spirits. On arriving at Annapolis—where those left in
prison joined us one week later—we were furnished new clothing
throughout, our old ones being full of “gray-backs,” and were supplied
with comfortable quarters. Very soon the boys began to scatter to their
homes, where most of them were allowed to remain until they were
exchanged, after which time they were ordered to report at Camp Chase.
About the 1st of September, most of them were on hand, and soon after
were sent to Martinsburg, Virginia, where the detachment of the regiment
which had escaped from Winchester were located under command of Maj.
Horace Kellogg, who had sufficiently recovered from his wound to again
take the field.

From this time the history of our organization, as a regiment again
commences. At this place we were newly armed and equipped, and being
deficient in officers, twenty-one being still in prison, were engaged
mainly in provost and picket duty until March 1st 1864. During the month
of November, Adjutant McCracken, with one non-commissioned officer from
each company was sent to Ohio to recruit, and fill up our depleted
ranks. Very good success was met with, adding one hundred and
twenty-eight men to our effective force; some promotions were also made;
sergeants S. A. Johnson, Elmer E. Husted, Charles M. Keyes and Martin W.
Willoughby were promoted to 2d lieutenants. The winter was quietly spent
in camp, which was located one-half mile west of town; when the weather
permitted, drilling by company and squad occurred daily, so that when
spring opened, the regiment was in good condition and ready for any duty
which might turn up. On March 1st, 1864, the companies were distributed
as guards along the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, between Harpers Ferry
and Monocacy Junction, with headquarters at Martinsburg.

About the 26th of March the regiment was collected together at
Martinsburg where Gen. Siegel was concentrating troops preparatory to a
movement up the valley; and from the orders issued to our little army,
we knew that our season of inaction was drawing to a close. On the 29th
we broke camp at Martinsburg and marched out to Bunker Hill, remaining
there two or three days, when we proceeded to Winchester and encamped
about two miles beyond the city; a portion of the regiment was sent into
the city, under command of Capt. Snyder to act as provost guard, with
orders to search the town, which was done, and a large collection of old
guns, swords and accoutrements were collected together and destroyed.
About the 1st of May our forces moved up the valley as far as Cedar
Creek, where they remained until the 10th making the final preparations
for our grand raid on Lynchburg. Baggage was cut down to the minimum;
each soldier was provided with an extra pair of shoes, and loaded down
with rations and ammunition, we broke camp, and moved leisurely on
through Strasburg, Woodstock, and Mt. Jackson, to New Market, where, on
the night of the 14th we struck the enemy in some force, our brigade
having the advance, we had a lively little skirmish, but of short
duration, the Rebels soon giving way. We laid on our arms during the
night, but no attack was made.

The next morning our brigade was maneuvered around in various
directions, the artillery placed in position, and things began to look
as though a battle was imminent, but for some unknown reason, the
remainder of our little army was not brought up; about noon the enemy
opened upon us with artillery, to which our batteries rapidly replied,
and soon their lines could be seen coming across the fields, two deep,
one directly behind the other, with a heavy line of skirmishers in
advance, and nothing but our brigade to receive them. We were in a good
position, and with the artillery on either flank, awaited their
approach. Soon our cannons opened on their rapidly advancing lines,
dealing death and destruction, but not checking them for an instant; on
they came, sweeping like an avalanche upon our little band. We held our
fire until they were almost within pistol shot, when we poured in our
volleys, with terrific effect; rapidly were our well directed volleys
given, doubling their first line back upon their second, that still came
unfalteringly on, lapping by our little line, both on the right flank
and the left, rapidly firing as they advanced until our little band
could no longer withstand their overwhelming numbers, and slowly we
began to retire—taking our cannon back through a cedar thicket, our
pathway marked with the blood of our braves. As they appeared over the
eminence we had lately occupied, they poured in upon us such a storm of
shot and shell, so thick that the very air seemed alive with bullets. On
passing through here on our way up the valley a month later, we examined
this spot, and found scarce a tree or bush unmarked, showing that the
fire at this point must have been severe indeed.

On the crest of the hill beyond another stand was made, which checked
their advance for a short time, but soon we were again compelled to fall
back, this time pretty badly shattered. Major Kellogg, commanding the
regiment, had his horse shot from under him and received quite a severe
wound himself. He, however, was supplied with another horse by the
officer commanding a battery near at hand, and again rallying his
command, which fell back in good order. By this time we had reached our
reserves on Rood’s Hill, about three miles from where the attack
commenced, which checked the enemies advance until night put an end to
the conflict.

In this engagement the regiments loss was sixty-three in killed and
wounded, and twenty-six missing. The missing being all taken prisoners,
many of whom were afterwards slowly tortured to death in prison. The
army was now drawn back to Ceder Creek, where we arrived on the 17th.
Gen. Siegel had been relieved and Gen. Hunter placed in command.




                               CHAPTER V.
                            LYNCHBURG RAID.


On the 22d of May, 1864, just previous to starting on this raid, the
General commanding issued the following order:

                               Headquarters Department West Virginia }
                        IN THE FIELD, NEAR CEDAR CREEK, May 22, 1864.}

  GENERAL ORDERS. }
      No. 29.     }

  It is of the utmost importance that this army be placed in a
  situation for immediate efficiency. We are contending against an
  enemy who is in earnest, and if we expect success, we too must be in
  earnest. We must be willing to make sacrifices, willing to suffer
  for a short time, that a glorious result may crown our efforts. The
  country is expecting every man to do his duty; and, this done, an
  ever kind Providence will certainly grant us a complete success.

  I. Every tent will be immediately turned in for transportation to
  Martinsburg; and all baggage not expressly allowed by this order,
  will be at once sent to the rear. There will be but one wagon
  allowed to each regiment, and this will only be used to transport
  spare ammunition, camp kettles, tools and mess-pans. Every wagon
  will have eight picked horses or mules, two drivers and two saddles.
  One wagon and one ambulance will be allowed to Department
  Headquarters, and the same to Division and Brigade Headquarters. The
  other ambulances will be under the immediate orders of the Medical
  Director.

  II. For the expedition on hand, the clothes each soldier has on his
  back, with one pair of extra shoes and socks, are amply sufficient.
  Everything else in the shape of clothing, will be packed to-day and
  sent to the rear. Each knapsack will contain one hundred rounds of
  ammunition, carefully packed, four pounds of hard bread, to last
  eight days, ten rations of coffee, sugar and salt, one pair of shoes
  and socks, and nothing else.

  III. Brigade and all other commanders will be held strictly
  responsible that their commands are amply supplied from the country.
  Cattle, sheep and hogs, and if necessary, horses and mules must be
  taken and slaughtered. These supplies will be seized under the
  direction of officers duly authorized, and upon a system which will
  hereafter be regulated. No straggling or pillaging will be allowed.
  Brigade and other commanders will be held responsible that there is
  no waste, and that there is a proper and orderly division amongst
  their men of the supplies taken for our use.

  IV. Commanders will attend personally to the prompt execution of
  this order, so that we may move to-morrow morning. They will see
  that in passing through a country in this way, depending upon it for
  forage and supplies, great additional vigilance is required on the
  part of every officer in the command of men, for the strict
  enforcement of discipline.

  V. The Commanding General expects from every officer and soldier of
  the army in the field, an earnest and unhesitating support; and
  relies, with confidence, upon an ever kind Providence for a glorious
  result. The Lieutenant General, commanding the armies of the United
  States, who is now victoriously pressing back the enemy upon their
  last stronghold, expects much from the Army of the Shenandoah; and
  he must not be disappointed.

  VI. In conclusion, the Major General commanding, while holding every
  officer to the strictest responsibility of his position, and
  prepared to enforce discipline with severity when necessary, will
  never cease to urge the prompt promotion of all officers;,
  non-commissioned officers and enlisted men who earn recognition by
  their gallantry and good conduct.

                                             By command of
                                                     MAJ. GEN. HUNTER:

  CHAS. G. HALPINE,
      Assistant Adjutant General.

                                                           [OFFICIAL.]

                                A. A. G.

At this time the 123d Ohio, with 116th and 28th Ohio, 18th Connecticut,
2d Indiana (P. H. B.) and 160th Ohio (N. G.), constituted the 1st
Brigade of the 1st Division; Col. Moore of the 28th Ohio Regiment
commanding, and Brig. Gen. Sullivan Division commander. The regiment was
then lying in camp at Cedar Creek, Maj. Kellogg being in command. During
the night of the 25th, Col. Wilson and Capt. Chamberlin rejoined the
regiment, just having been exchanged as prisoners of war. In compliance
with the order just given, each man was required to pack in his knapsack
one hundred rounds of ammunition, which in addition to the extra
clothing allowed, and four days rations of hard bread, caused some
grumbling among the men at being converted into a pack train as they
styled it.

On the morning of the 2d, Col. Wilson having assumed command of the
regiment, Gen. Hunter, with his whole command, started up the valley on
the proposed trip to Lynchburg. The regiment reported four hundred men
for duty. We marched fourteen miles, and went into camp. Next morning we
were routed out at 4 o’clock to see how promptly we could get into “line
of battle,” which was done in just five minutes. We remained here in
camp until Sunday morning the 29th, drilling some. One day the whole
regiment was ordered out as a foraging party; reported at Division
Headquarters for duty, when the order was countermanded and we were sent
back to our quarters. We now had ten commissioned company officers with
the regiment. Dr. Ferris was acting as Brigade Surgeon, and the Chaplain
as Postmaster. Sunday we marched to Rood’s Hill, and went into camp. The
next day details from each regiment were busy scouring the country and
bringing in all the provisions they could discover. A few men from the
regiment, under Capt. Dwight Kellogg, were placed in charge of a mill
near by, and began making flour as fast as possible, running night and
day. The 10th Ohio (N. G.), complaining very much of being taken to the
front, were sent back on the 30th. On June 1st, flour was issued to the
men for the first time since we entered the service. It took some time
for them to become accustomed to the use of it, but our hard tack was
exhausted and it was “slap-jacks” or nothing. At 5 o’clock on the
morning of the 2d, we again started, passing through New Market. We saw
a few Rebels once during the day, when we were halted and formed in line
of battle; but it amounted to nothing, and we soon passed on; about 3
o’clock P. M., we reached Harrisburg, a distance of twenty-two miles.
Our advance had a small skirmish with the “Jonnies,” but nothing serious
occured. The main force encamped about a mile from town, the 123d going
into camp just within the suburbs. In a few moments, Capt. Chamberlin,
with a hundred and fifty men, was sent into town with directions to
picket around the town, and with the remainder of the men to search
thoroughly for arms, provisions and every thing that could be used by
the army. Soon after, fifty more men were sent from the regiment and
quartered in the Court House. Lieutenants Leonard and Williams were in
charge of the pickets; and Lieutenants Keyes, Hustead and Willoughby of
the Provost guards, under direction of Lieut. Col. Starr, Provost
Marshal General, and at once destroyed the press, type, etcs., belonging
to the office of the _Rockingham Register_ then remained under arms all
night. Next day the men were divided into small parties, and searched
the town completely; the result of which was an accumulation in the
Court House yard of seventy-five barrels of flour, a lot of meat, sugar,
corn, wheat, tobacco, (the most plentiful article found), a bale of
sheeting and some arms and accoutrements. Capt. Chamberlin, at his
quarters, was bothered all day by men, women and children, who were
endeavoring to recover certain articles thus appropriated. Some
pleading, some demanding and others threatning what their friends would
do to “you’ns,” if they were at home. Three or four families were
excepted from the search on the account of their Unionism and kindness
to wounded Federal soldiers, who fell into their hands at the battle of
New Market, and who were able to designate with unerring certainty those
who should be thus excepted. During the day the remainder of the 123d
moved into town and took up their quarters near the Court House. Next
morning, Saturday, June 24th, we started for Staunton directly, distant
only twenty-four miles; but after marching two or three miles, we left
the pike to the right, and attempted to flank into Crawford, where the
pike crosses the Shenandoah; we reached the river about 1 o’clock P. M.,
and remained there some three hours, while the Pontoon Corps was
bridging the river. During this time our troops destroyed a large woolen
factory just across the river, in a small town called Port Republic;
then marching through the town just at dark, we went into camp in the
_brush_, the teams did not get up till midnight.

On the morning of the 5th, we started at 5 o’clock, our regiment being
at once deployed as skirmishers on the left of the Brigade. Our cavalry
videttes soon met the enemy and had quite a skirmish; they falling back
to near a little town called Piedmont, about nine miles from our camp of
the night previous. The 123d was soon placed along the wagon train as
guard. About 10 o’clock A. M.; our force attacked the enemy in their
position, which was a strong one; a heavy fight was kept up until 3
o’clock P. M., when a furious charge was made by both Brigades of
infantry, completely driving them out of their works, routing them
thoroughly, and capturing one thousand two hundred prisoners, among whom
was Gen. Vaughn. Rebel General Jones was killed. The loss on both sides
was very great, both Union and Rebel dead being found side by side all
over the field. The 123d was ordered up just at the close of the action,
but not in time to participate. Early next morning company A was sent
out to the battlefield to gather up and destroy the arms lying there,
some one thousand two hundred stands. While engaged in the performance
of this duty, under the direction of the Provost Marshal General, by
piling them up in large piles, first a tier of rails, then one of
muskets, muzzles all pointing one way, for many of them were loaded, and
although the men had been repeatedly cautioned by Capt. Chamberlin and
Lieut. Husted, not to go in front of the piles, Sergeant Baroff
incautiously did so; at this moment one of the pieces was discharged by
a rail thrown on the pile, the ball passing nearly through his right
leg, half way between the knee and hip, shattering the bone very badly
and rendering amputation imperatively necessary. He was at once taken
back to the Field Hospital, since which time nothing was ever heard from
him. The company immediately joined the regiment already on their march
toward Staunton, arriving there about 4 P. M., a distance of twelve
miles, being the first Union Infantry that had ever been there. We met
with no resistance whatever, the Rebels having fled in another
direction. We found several hundred of their sick and wounded here. The
regiment went into camp one mile west of town. Dr. Brisbine, who had
been promoted to Assistant Surgeon, joined the regiment while on the
march. Before leaving here our troops destroyed the railroad depot,
bridges, track and telegraph, in and near town.

We then started for Buffalo Gap, distant ten miles, marching in three
columns, cavalry and artillery in the road, and a brigade of infantry on
each side. We marched some five miles through woods and underbrush, then
halted and in a short time returned, and went into the same camp we had
occupied the night previous. An ambulance train was sent back to the
battlefield after the wounded, returning late at night. Gen. Averill,
with whom we were expecting to make a junction at this point, arrived
with his command, making us, now, quite a formidable little army.

In the afternoon of June 7th, three hundred and fifty men and eight
officers, under command of Capt. Chamberlin, were sent out to relieve
the 28th Ohio, then doing picket duty. Part of the men were stationed on
a hill where, just about a year before, they were permitted to rest for
a few hours, when on their way to Richmond as prisoners of war. The
contrast between their situation then and now was vividly appreciated by
the boys.

On the 9th the regiment returned to camp, and shoes were issued to those
of the men who needed them. The prisoners captured at Port Republic,
were sent to the rear in charge of the 28th Ohio—whose term of service
having expired—was going home. Here Chaplain Ferris resigned, his
resignation being accepted at once; and he left for home with this
return train. Our command left next morning, moving on three different
roads, Averill on one, Crooks on another, and Hunter on the Lexington
road. Our regiment marched in the rear as wagon guard. A very long and
dusty march, passed through Greenville—where a large mill was
destroyed—to Midway, a distance of eighteen miles, where we went into
camp very tired. In a few moments company A was sent out as a support to
a battery of artillery near the picket line, Saturday the 11th. We
started at 5 A. M., drew rations of flour just as we left, but no time
was allowed to prepare any of it; on this account, and the great heat
and dust, the men became very much fatigued before night, and very many
were compelled to fall back during the day. We marched seventeen miles
to within sight of Lexington. We found Gen. Crooks here in advance and
skirmishing with a small force of the enemy, who had burned the bridge
over the river, and then scattered some sharpshooters along the shore,
to harass our men, while constructing their pontoon bridge; but our
troops soon drove them back with but small loss on our part. While this
was being done, our division of infantry lay in position about two miles
from town from 2 to 6 P. M. We then went into camp about half a mile
from the river.

Next day we crossed the river and went into camp in the edge of town.
Military Institute, which is located here, was destroyed. On the 13th we
still remained in camp. Some canal-boats were captured with artillery
and ammunition which were destroyed. Next morning we were early on the
move again, and although it was extremely warm and dusty, we succeeded
in making a distance of twenty-four miles to Buckannon. We passed within
two miles of the natural bridge, but there was no time for hunting
curiosities. Our march was along an old plank-road. The Rebels had
endeavored to destroy many small bridges, and thus obstruct our
progress; but we were so close on them, they succeeded in doing but
little damage, until we reached Buckannon, where we found the bridge
over the James River in ruins, and we were compelled to cross in canal
barges. Two companies of the regiment were guarding prisoners, under
command of Lieutenants Leonard and Keyes. Our “hard-tack” was all gone,
and flour getting scarce, but fresh beef and mutton still plenty. The
next day we were on the road about 9 A. M., and went to the edge of
town, where we laid until after dinner, when we again started in the
direction of Lynchburg. We crossed Otter Peak, a very high mountain,
with a very narrow, rough road over it. In many places our way was
obstructed by trees that had been felled across; undoubtedly done by
Bushwhackers, for in one place there lay the dead body of one, who had
been caught in the act and slain by our advance. We went into camp, for
the night, at 9 o’clock, about halfway down the mountain.

The following morning we started at 5 o’clock, marched through Liberty
to a point five miles beyond where we went into camp. While halting in
the town, several men of the “5th Heavies” were pillaging a large
dwelling house—in which the family were still residing—of pictures,
books, and other articles that could be of no use to them. A squad of
men from company A, were sent into the house with orders to clean them
out at the point of the bayonet, which was promptly done. The 123d was
all on picket again at night.

On the 17th we started as usual very early. After marching two miles, to
the creek, we found the bridge burned, and had to wait some three hours
for the Pontoon corps to repair damages. We then moved on through New
London. Generals Crooks’ and Averill’s commands met the enemy, and had
quite an engagement some three miles from Lynchburg. They drove the
Rebels from two different positions, capturing some artillery and
prisoners. We arrived at the front about dark, and relieved the advanced
line. Company F was immediately sent out on the skirmish line. This
morning a part of the wagon train was detached and sent to the rear. Two
“One-Hundred-Day” regiments accompanied them as escort. We had marched
twenty-four miles, and, it being very hot, many of the men gave out. On
the morning of the 18th company F was relieved by company D, under
command of Capt. Shawhan, the former having lost three killed, Sergeant
Dunn, and Privates Kiehl and Savage, and six wounded. The Rebel skirmish
line was composed of sharpshooters, many of whom were armed with
long-range rifles, and stationed in tree-tops, doing severe execution.
All night we could hear the trains running into Lynchburg, bringing
reinforcements from Richmond, and the next morning skirmishing commenced
at once, and fighting, to some extent, continued all day. Company D,
while on the skirmish line, was under a sharp fire nearly all the time,
which, however, resulted in no loss to them.

Company G had one man, private Stokely, wounded by the explosion of a
shell. About dusk it was decided to fall back, and at 8 o’clock P. M.,
we commenced our retrograde movement; we marched all night, reaching
Otter Creek the next morning, the 19th, after a very tedious and severe
tramp; the boys being very much exhausted and needing rest, a great many
dropping down by the side of the road, would fall asleep on the road,
and it would be almost impossible to arouse them. We encamped two miles
beyond Liberty, where we rested a couple of hours, and then moved on.
While here our rear had some severe skirmishing with the enemy, who were
endeavoring to harass our troops and cut off part of our train, but were
repulsed and driven off. About 2 o’clock A. M., on the 20th, we rested a
couple of hours, then moved on till 8 o’clock A. M., when we halted an
hour for breakfast. While here Gen. Hunter, in person, asked for two
companies of the regiment to destroy a large pile of wood and a water
tank on the railroad near by, which was done effectually. We went into
camp at noon, having marched forty five miles in forty hours and on very
limited rations, in fact nothing but fresh beef and mutton. We had
rested only a few moments when there was some skirmishing in our rear,
and we were ordered to move forward again. We marched on all night, this
being the third night without any sleep, through Conyer Springs and Big
Lick to within one mile of Salem, arriving there on the morning of the
21st, where we found skirmishing again in progress; the Rebels
endeavoring to get in our front. Two companies of our regiment were
immediately sent out as skirmishers, but met no enemy. We rested there
until 10 o’clock, when we moved on through Salem about two miles, where
we found the enemy had attacked the train and captured sixteen pieces of
artillery and some men, but being closely pressed only succeeded in
disabling six pieces, taking none away with them. We then made a forced
march of seven miles, which we did in one hour and twenty minutes, to
overtake the train. We rested there two hours, and were highly
complimented by Col. Wells, our brigade commander, for our close and
rapid marching with no straggling. We moved on again at 4 o’clock P. M.,
marching on a regular “back and forth” road, over a mountain, and went
into camp twelve miles from Salem, having marched twenty-four miles in
twenty-four hours. Meat and coffee in small quantities were issued to
the men at this point.

On the morning of the 22d we were ordered into line and maneuvered
around some, but did not get fairly started until 1 o’clock P. M. We
marched in the rear of the column all day, encamping at half past ten in
a very stony field at New Castle Court House; just before arriving there
we forded Craig’s creek three times. The men were completely jaded, many
dropping down where they stood, when the regiment halted, and almost
instantly falling asleep.

We were aroused at 2 o’clock for an early start, but were delayed by the
wagon train until 9 A. M. Our entire brigade acted as train guard, one
company to every ten wagons, and a heavy escort for the artillery. This
was the hardest day’s march in our experience, not on account of its
length, but that it was over three mountains—we were now crossing the
Alleghanies—one of them being eleven miles over, and a portion of the
time we had to march very rapidly to keep up with the train. Horses and
mules were “playing out” in great numbers, and had to be pushed from the
road, over the side of the mountain, in order that the train might pass.
The weather continued very hot and dry, and the road very dusty; we made
a halt of two hours at half past 10 in the evening, for coffee and
mutton, nearly all being too tired to prepare it for eating; then on
again for six miles, going into camp at half past 3 in the morning at
Sweet Springs. We remained there until 4 P. M., when we started for
“White Sulphur” Springs. The road was very rough, and the night quite
dark, making this a very severe march; we arrived there at half past 3,
the next morning, June 24th.

This was the place where the southern aristocracy, before the war, came
to air their wealth and gamble for darkies.

It must have been a very pretty spot then, with its living springs of
clear, cold water, and fine mountain scenery on all sides; but to us, it
was simply a place to rest our wearied limbs for a few hours. We now had
nothing but meat to eat, and very little of that.

We started again in the afternoon, passing through Lewisburg, and going
into camp four miles beyond at mid-night. Just at sunset we waded
Greenbrier River, where it was about fifty rods wide and waist deep. We
crossed in three columns, forming a beautiful sight to one placed where
he could view it. The sun shining on the water and on the polished
gun-barrels made it dazzling to the eyes, while every now and then some
unfortunate fellow would make a miss step and get a complete ducking,
thereby creating a laugh at his expense.

On the 26th, we marched all day, resting once for a little time, when
the men drew some beef. We had a nice little shower in the afternoon,
the first rain since leaving Staunton. Next day we marched eighteen
miles, our regiment taking the advance. It rained hard after we went
into camp, and we put up our “Dog-Tents,” the first time we had done it
for ten days. We here met a small train, from which was issued
three-fourths of a day’s rations of hard bread, bacon, sugar and coffee.
The men slaughtered a few straggling porkers they discovered near camp,
and then managed to have a real jolly supper in the rain.

We were on the road early on the morning of the 28th, and, at noon, met
another train, and drew two days’ rations of hard bread.

On the 29th our march was over quite a hilly road, along the New River,
through mountain gorges, and over rushing streams, crossing Gauley River
at Gauley Bridge—no bridge however only in name—where the Gauley and New
Rivers unite and form the Kanawha. Near this spot is a view of natural
scenery, almost rivalling Niagara in some respects. Upon a ledge of
rocks overhanging the river, you can stand and look directly down a
distance of two hundred feet to the bed of the river, then cast your
eyes directly in front of you and see the other river coming down
through the mountain gorges and emptying into the New, while all around
the mountains tower up in all their majesty and grandeur. We went into
camp about one mile beyond the bridge.

The Lynchburg raid may now be called completed, for we have again
reached our supplies. This march was very severe on our regiment, and
many were now sick and worn out. Our rations were exhausted before we
were fully started, and, a large portion of the country through which we
passed, being very sparsely settled, we found great difficulty in
procuring food, as the country had nothing in it to eat either for man
or beast. For four days the regiment marched day and night, not halting
over two hours at any one time. For nine days we had nothing to eat but
fresh beef and mutton, and a very little coffee. With all this the heat
was intense, the roads very dusty, and the men became so completely
exhausted, that frequently when the command halted, they would drop down
just where they stood, and to get them started again, it was necessary
to arouse every man, and not only arouse him, but get him on his feet,
and even then they could often be seen in the ranks, marching along,
sound asleep. Had there been anything in the country to subsist upon, we
might have taken it leisurely, but as it was—it was simply a march for
rations, and this fact the men all understood, for it was so stated in a
general order from Army Headquarters, and read to each regiment, hence
there was little or no grumbling at the severity of our marching.

As the result of this raid—we marched five hundred miles since leaving
Martinsburg, destroying a large amount of property, captured fifteen
hundred prisoners, over a thousand head of cattle, a large number of
sheep, besides living—if it could be called living—off the country
through which we passed. Several hundred negroes came through with us,
many of them remaining with the various regiments as servants. On the
other hand, we lost about one thousand horses and mules that gave out,
and nearly one hundred wagons, that we were compelled to destroy, and
lost quite a number of men, who were “played out,” and undoubtedly fell
into the hands of the enemy. The men’s shoes were giving out some
partially, and occasionally one would be seen entirely bare-foot,
trudging along with the rest, for it was sure capture to straggle, and
the men knew it. The main object of the raid, which was doubtless to
threaten Lynchburg, and thus cause Lee to weaken his forces in front of
Richmond, by sending reinforcements to Lynchburg, was fully obtained.

The regiment was mustered for pay on the 30th, and remained in camp
until July 2d, when we started for Camp Piatt, a distance of
twenty-seven miles, there to take boats for some place unknown. It was a
very warm day, and by 1 o’clock, we had marched fifteen miles, barely
stopping once, a few minutes for rest. The men appeared to suffer more
from this day’s march, than any previous one. Each man had three days’
rations in his haversack, and eating very freely, nearly every one was
afflicted with that terrible camp disease, dysentery. Resting two hours,
we then moved on four miles and camped for the night.

Next morning we were on the way again, reaching Camp Piatt at 5 o’clock.
On the morning of the 4th, company A with a portion of the “5th Heavies”
(5th N. Y. H. Artillery) and the Pioneer corps were loaded on the
steamboat, “Mattie Roberts,” and moved down the river slowly, the
remainder of the regiment following in other boats. At Gallipolis the
regiment was changed to the “Anglo Saxon.” Then moving up the Ohio, we
soon had to change to the “Inno,” a light draft boat, on account of the
low stage of water in the river. Opposite Blennerhasset’s Island, we
found we could get no further and were compelled to land and march into
Parkersburg, a distance of six miles. At 10 o’clock of the 6th, the
regiment was loaded on cars and started for our old home again, the
Shenandoah Valley, arriving at Cherry Run on the 8th of July and went
into camp.




                              CHAPTER VI.
 FROM CHERRY RUN TO THE TIME THAT SHERIDAN TOOK COMMAND, INCLUDING THE
   BATTLES OF SNICKER’S FERRY, WINCHESTER, JULY 22D, AND MARTINSBURG.


Two days’ rest at this place when we were again on the road, without
having received any supplies of clothing, although sadly needing them;
many of the boys were bare-footed, and all, with uniforms, filthy and in
tatters,—as can readily be concieved, when it is taken into
consideration, that they had been used for marching in by day and
sleeping in by night, with nothing to protect them from the pelting
storm while marching, or from the ground while lying down, and this for
over six weeks upon a raid, which for continuous fighting, severe
marching and scarcity of rations, the history of the war presents no
parallel.

Arriving at Martinsburg on the afternoon of July 13th, we visited some
of our old haunts, and found that things had undergone changes
generally, that the Rebels had been here, since we’d been gone, was
evident, as many of our officers found out to their displeasure. All of
our baggage, and camp and garrison equipage, was stored here, when
starting on the “raid” up the valley; the officers leaving their valises
at different private houses, containing their best clothing, all of
which had been visited, and their contents duly confiscated. Lieutenants
Johnson and Keyes being the only ones overlooked, for which they were
duly thankful, and indulged in a little merriment at their brother
officers’ misfortune.

On the 13th we broke camp, taking the road towards Harper’s Ferry,
arriving there the next forenoon. On the 15th we again started out,
crossing the river on a pontoon bridge, and marched down to Berlin, a
little dried-up town, six miles below the Ferry, on the north bank of
the Potomac, with no feature of interest, save the wildly beautiful
scenery that abounds on either hand; the bold bluffs on the opposite
bank—tree-crowned—seemingly guarding the noble river below, while away
to the southward, the Blue Ridge, rising tier on tier, giving the
surrounding atmosphere that peculiar hue, from which this range of
mountains takes its name, and to the westward rises, almost to the very
clouds, in picturesque beauty, the historic heights at Harper’s Ferry.

We had been detailed as escort to a battery of artillery, and early on
the following morning, the “crossing over” began. The river at this
point runs with great rapidity, and the bottom at the ford, we found to
be full of huge boulders, causing many a mishap and much labor;
sometimes a horse would go down almost out of sight, but, at last, by
swimming and wading, the crossing of the artillery was safely effected;
the men were transported over on an old flat-boat that lay rotting, near
by, on the shore. We pushed rapidly forward to Purcillville, an
insignificant hamlet, near Snicker’s Gap.

The next day being Sunday, and, for a wonder, not being called upon for
any sort of duty, was passed in a sort of sleepy, dreamy way—a fact
noticeable throughout our whole command. Since the severe marching and
physical endurance of the past two months.

Early on Monday, the 18th, our division moved down to Snicker’s Ferry,
where the enemy was posted in force on the other side of the river. Our
brigade was immediately pushed forward, plunging into the water, which
was waist deep, we crossed over, driving the Rebels before us, and took
a position on the west bank of the famed Shenandoah. The rest of the
division soon joined us, and our line of battle was rapidly formed. We
had thrown out a heavy line of skirmishers, as soon as the crossing was
effected, Col. Wilson taking charge of them in person, mounted on his
black charger, he rode from one end of the line to the other, getting it
firmly established, and, though the air was thick with bullets, he
escaped unharmed.

Here occurred one of those unfortunate fights in which it was the
fortune of our forces so often to participate during the course of the
war. Our lines were formed in something of a circle on the top of a
knoll extending along the river, where, from the maneuvering of the
enemy, we could see that they were in strong force. Soon they came
charging down upon us, but our line stood firm as a rock, and sent them
whirling back into the woods, where they re-formed their broken line,
and with reinforcements came again to the attack, shaking their banners
and yelling like mad-men, they came, but only to recoil, broken and
shattered before our deadly volleys. Once again did they charge our
unshaken line, but to be hurled back as before.

Night was now rapidly coming on, and we were anxiously looking for the
balance of our troops to cross the river, but they did not come, and
after twice getting orders, we began slowly to recross the river.

Our regiment and the 34th Massachusetts, than which there was no braver
nor more gallant regiment in the service—were left to protect the rear,
and of course, were the last to effect the crossing, in doing which many
lives were lost, quite a number of men in the regiment being either shot
in the river or drowned in its rushing waters.

Lieut. Willoughby, of company F, was wounded, and Lieut. Williams, of
company B, was killed, while fording the river—a noble-hearted fellow,
mourned by all who knew him. Orderly Davis, of company A, mortally
wounded while firing the last shot at the enemy, was carried to an
Island midway of the stream, where he was left to die—but before his
brave spirit winged its flight to that other camping ground, he placed
under a log by his side, his watch, pocket-book, knife, and all of his
trinkets, and the next day when his comrades returned to the spot to
give him burial, these things were missed; when the log being
accidentally misplaced, his treasures were disclosed, and afterwards
were sent home to his wife. Knowing his hours were few, lying there
alone, dying, with only God’s Angels watching over him, his last
thoughts were of the dear ones at home, secreting his effects as
narrated, hoping them to fall into the hands of his friends, that his
wife and babies might receive this, his last, his dying gift. We often
read of heroism upon the battle field when the blood is up, with flags
waving in the breeze, bright bayonets gleaming on every side, and the
thundering of cannon crashing through the air. But thus to die alone, to
fill an unknown and forgotten grave, with the sad murmurings of the
Shenandoah chaunting its endless requiem around his resting-place, and
leave such evidence of coolness and christian fortitude in meeting the
grim messenger face to face, is a kind of bravery before which that of
the battlefield pales into insignificance.

Sergeant Hart, our color bearer, was shot in the arm while going down
the bank. Adjutant McCracken standing near by, relieved him of the flag
and started across the river, but getting into deep water, was compelled
to let it go in the rushing waters, in order to save himself. The flag
however was recovered soon after, it having lodged in a fallen tree just
below, and after being borne through several other engagements, was sent
to Columbus, where, a mere shred, it now hangs in the Arm and Trophy
Department of the State.

Why we were not supported in this engagement was always a mystery to us,
unless our finding the enemy in force determined Gen. Wright that it
would not be prudent to cross over more troops, and so issued the order
for us to fall back.

We found the 6th and 19th corps’ drawn up in good shape, and as we
marched through their lines, our little division did not present a very
flattering appearance—as every man was wet “through and through,” and
generally covered with mud, from climbing the clay river banks. We
encamped under the shelter of a dense woods, just back from the river,
and proceeded to dry our clothing, and get our guns and ammunition in
condition for service.

On the 19th, the 6th and 19th corps’ moved off in the direction of
Washington, and we heard, that they had got up another scare at the
capital. The next day after the departure of these troops, we again
crossed the river higher up, at the regular ford, in a drenching rain
storm; we waded the river, which, at this point, was about two feet
deep, and it was quite laughable to see some of the men attempt to keep
dry. We went into camp just on the other side, remaining there until the
next day, when we pushed on to Winchester.

On the 24th, about noon, signs of the enemy’s approach became evident,
and our forces were soon in position, and at 2 o’clock a fierce battle
was once more raging around the valley city. For several hours the field
was fiercely contested, when, being overpowered on all sides, our troops
were compelled to fall back, saving all our trains, and taking with us
the most of our wounded. It will be remembered that we were opposed by
the same army that we measured strength with over the same ground one
month later, after being reinforced by the 6th and 19th corps’, with
Gen. Sheridan commanding. In this engagement the gallant Gen. Mulligan
fell, fighting at the head of his division, just as the day was lost.

No shoes or clothing had been issued to our men since the Hunter raid,
and many of our boys were still bare-foot, for such of them, that
retreat, was simply terrible; many of them unable to walk upon their
blood-clotted feet, were compelled to fall out and were taken prisoners,
most of whom died afterwards from cruel treatment in Andersonville. We
made a stand at Bunker Hill, holding the enemy in check until early next
morning, then fell back to Martinsburg, skirmishing all the way. We held
the town until all the military stores at this point, together with our
sick and wounded, had been put into cars and started for Cumberland, on
the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad; when with our train we fell back to
Williamsport, fording the Potomac. On the morning of the 26th we pushed
on through Sharpsburg, thence to Pleasant Valley, on to Harper’s Ferry,
where we again crossed the Potomac, and went into camp on the 28th at
Hall Town, four miles distant.

Thus in sixteen days had we, in our worn-out condition, many of the men
without shoes or proper clothing, fought in two severe engagements and
marched one hundred and ninety miles. Here we made out clothing and pay
rolls, and on July 30th, while issuing clothing to the men, received
orders to march to the defense of the Capitol, and immediately started
back into Maryland. None who were on that march will soon forget the
intense heat of that July day; it is said that over one hundred of the
army died from sun stroke, and many more were seriously effected. After
marching around through Maryland for four or five days, it was
discovered that the “Washington scare” had been over estimated, and on
the 5th of August we went into camp at Monocacy, where our division was
ordered out at sun-down to witness the execution of a deserter from the
23d O. V. I., being the first and only time during the war that our
regiment was called upon to witness such a scene.




                              CHAPTER VII.
  THE CAMPAIGN UNDER GENERAL SHERIDAN UP TO THE TIME THE REGIMENT WAS
     TRANSFERRED TO THE ARMY OF THE JAMES, INCLUDING THE BATTLES OF
          BERRYVILLE, OPEQUAN, FISHER’S HILL AND CEDAR CREEK.


While the regiment was lying at Pleasant Valley, Gen. Sheridan assumed
command of the entire department of West Virginia, which was hereafter
to be called the Department of the Shenandoah. A new state of warfare
was now inaugurated. The Rebels of the beautiful valley were to be
taught a lesson which they would never forget, and victory was hereafter
to perch upon our banners. Everything now assumed an air of business and
preparation; clothing and shoes, which were much needed by the men, were
issued in abundance, and our boys again felt that spirit of confidence
which is a sure prelude to success. On Monday, August 8th, we crossed
the river at Harper’s Ferry, and encamped on the banks of the
Shenandoah, near Hall-Town; remaining there until the 10th, when we
again started up the valley; encamping at night near Berryville. The
next day we marched up the river through a wild, picturesque region of
country; it was a very warm day, and the men suffered greatly for the
want of water. We encamped about eighteen miles from our start of the
morning. The next day we changed our direction to the right until we
struck the valley pike at Middletown, where we found that our cavalry
had been pushing the Rebels down the road from Martinsburg. We went into
camp about three miles from Cedar Creek, and during the four days we
remained here, our boys subsisted mainly upon “roasting ears,” we having
arrived just in time to help the good people of that section enjoy this
luxury. On the evening of the 26th we received orders to move, and just
before starting, Col. Wilson was taken very ill—the result of an
overdose of morphine, administered by Surgeon Hyatt, and the command of
the regiment devolved upon Capt. Chamberlin. We moved back to Winchester
that night, and the next day we marched to Berryville. All this time
Col. Wilson was very sick, and of course could receive but little care;
but he was now taken to a farm-house near by, and every attention paid
him possible. The Colonel finally recovered, though it was a long time
before he was himself again.

On the 18th we moved back to a small place called Clifton, remaining
there until the 20th; on this day our regiment reported three hundred
and sixty men and six officers for duty; Capt. Kellogg, of Company E,
and Lieut. Leonard, of Company D, joining us that evening.

The next morning the regiment went out as guard to a forage train, and
while loading our wagons, heavy skirmishing, with the occasional firing
of artillery, was heard near by, and we hurried back to camp, only to
find it deserted. After considerable traveling, we found our proper
place in the line of battle which had been formed, and went to work
building a breast work of rails, which we had to carry quite a distance.
Early in the evening we moved out to support a battery in our front, but
as night came on the firing ceased, and about 11 o’clock a retrograde
movement commenced in the direction of Harper’s Ferry; and after
marching about fourteen miles, we came to the place where our troops
were going into camp. Our brigade commander, who was with our regiment,
had, in the darkness, lost the rest of his brigade, and we had the honor
of escorting him around hunting for it. At last, in disgust, he told us
to go into camp—where we had a mind to—an order which we very quickly
obeyed.

On the following morning skirmishing was again going on in our front,
and before noon we were at work fortifying, and by night our division
was strongly entrenched.

We remained here until the 28th, and during the first three days we were
here a continuous roar of skirmish firing was going on along the whole
line; if a soldier from either side showed his head above his pile of
rails, he was sure to be made a target of. The officers of our division
tried to stop this kind of warfare, but with little effect, until the
25th, when the 123d was sent out on the line in front of our brigade;
when by the exertion of our commanding officer, skirmish firing, which
had been almost continuous from both sides, was stopped by our regiment,
and when it was noticed by the Rebels that we were not doing the usual
amount of firing, they also ceased, and we were soon on easy terms with
them, trading papers, coffee for tobacco, etc.

Our example soon became generally adopted, and firing ceased along the
whole front. We were highly complimented by Gen. Thoburne for the prompt
manner in which the nuisance was stopped.

On the morning of the 27th it was discovered that the Rebels had
abandoned their position, and we received orders to be in readiness to
move without baggage, and with three days rations, to last four days.
Early on the 28th, we started, but stopped near Charleston, where we
remained until September 3d. The time was occupied in making clothing
and pay-rolls, and on the 31st of August, the regiment was mustered and
received four months’ pay.

We broke camp early on the morning of September 3d, moving up the valley
in three columns, the 6th corps having the right, the 19th corps the
center, and Gen. Crook’s command, to which we belonged, having the left.
Our command reached Berryville, arriving about noon. Pickets were sent
out, and being attacked, our division was sent forward to their support,
in doing which our regiment, or six companies of them, the others being
on picket, became heavily engaged with a brigade of Rebels, whom we run
into a cornfield almost before we were aware of their presence. We gave
them three or four volleys, when they came charging down upon us and we
were forced to retire, losing four killed and fifteen wounded. As soon
as we reached our reserves our line was halted and we laid there on our
arms all night, expecting the fight would be renewed in the morning. It
rained most of the night, and was quite cold; taking it all in all, we
had a pretty rough night of it. Our corps was assigned its position on
the line in the morning and commenced building “breast works”, and right
here we might say that these, like all the others we built during the
war, were never fired over, it always being our privilege to be the
attacking party. We remained here for some time, working on the
fortifications and doing picket duty. On the 7th, Lieut. Col. Kellogg
came up and took command of the regiment, Capt. Chamberlin having been
in command since August 17th.

The Colonel had been sick in hospital, and had quite an adventure while
on his way from the ferry to the regiment, in company with a surgeon in
charge of an ambulance train, and without escort. All went well until
within seven or eight miles of the army, when it now being about 5
o’clock P. M., they were suddenly pounced upon in front and rear by a
gang of bushwhackers, under command of the redoubtable “Mosby;”
fortunately the Colonel and Surgeon were pretty well ahead of the train,
and the main body of the Rebels had came on the road behind them, so
putting spur to their horses, they dashed down the road, brushing the
Rebs in their immediate pathway aside, and away up the pike at a
break-neck speed they went, when in about twenty minutes, reaching a
cavalry out-post, Col. Cellogg persuaded the Sergeant in charge, with
about twenty men, to go back with him and recapture the train. Flying
over the ground, they were soon upon them, and going in with a yell,
they scattered the “Jonnies” in every direction, recovering the entire
train before the Rebels could get it turned around and in shape to get
away, thus saving to the government many thousands of dollars, and to
the army a much needed train of ambulances. Had Col. Kellogg waited
until a strong force of cavalry could have been secured, as most
officers would have done, it would have been too late, and Mosby, with
his plunder, well out of reach in the mountains. We now had a splendid
army, and knew we could whip the Rebs at any time, and the wonder
throughout the army was “why don’t we do it.” We afterwards learned that
Gen. Grant’s orders were to avoid a decisive engagement if possible, as
it would not do, at that time, for this army to suffer a defeat.

Captain Shawhan joined the regiment on the 12th, and on the 15th, Col.
Kellogg receiving a “sick leave,” went to his home, the command of the
regiment again devolving upon Capt. Chamberlin.

September 16th our army was visited by Gen. Grant, in order to confer in
person with Gen. Sheridan. The General saw that all Gen. Sheridan wanted
was permission to strike—it was given in two words—“go in”—and we went.

The army was in motion before daylight on Monday the 19th, and before
night closed upon us, the famous battle of “Opequan” was fought and won.
We took the road in the direction of Winchester, the 6th and 19th corps’
having the advance. Firing commenced as soon as we were fairly started,
and increased in volume as we advanced, to that roar which indicates the
heavy engagement. We reached the Perryville Pike where it crosses the
Opequan Creek, about 10 o’clock A. M., where we were held in reserve
until about 2 o’clock P. M., when we were ordered up. We crossed the
creek, and made our way along a narrow, woody gorge up to the front.

The road was crowded with artillery, ammunition wagons, and ambulances,
also with prisoners and wounded men moving to the rear, in fact, it was
so choked up that it was with difficulty we picked our way through the
debris.

We at length reached a ravine, in front of which was a narrow strip of
woods, and along its southern edge a division of the 19th corps was
posted, and seemingly, heavily engaged. We were rapidly massed in column
by brigade, with ours in front, and immediately moved forward, relieving
this portion of the 19th corps, and as soon as they were massed and
ready, the bugle sounded the advance, and we moved forward on the
double-quick. Now commenced one of the most exciting charges ever
participated in by a large army; for over two miles we drove them, over
stone fences, up hills and down ravines, until about 4 o’clock P. M.,
when, our cavalry getting on their flank, they, no longer making any
stand, went flying down the valley with Averill’s and Merritt’s gallant
riders in hot pursuit. The 123d was the first regiment over the
fortifications and into the city of Winchester. We went into the fight
with six officers and one hundred and eighty-two men, losing seven men
killed and three officers—Capt. Shawhan, Lieutenants Snyder and
Johnson—and forty-two men wounded, receiving special praise from Gen.
Thoburn, for our gallant conduct.

In this truly great battle we captured nearly three thousand prisoners,
five guns, and nine battle flags. Gen. Sheridan’s dispatch announcing
the victory, was, “We have just sent them whirling through Winchester,
and we are after them to-morrow. The army behaved splendidly.”

The next day we moved up the valley to Strasburg; where on the hills
beyond, the Rebel army, in a naturally strong position, had fortified
themselves, determined again to try the issue of battle.

We were maneuvered around some until the morning of the 22d, when the
two divisions of our corps were moved back about three miles, where
getting under cover, we changed our direction to the left, up the side
of the mountain, and then silently stole towards the Rebel lines. We
crept along the mountain until about 3 o’clock P. M., when getting
squarely on their flank, our lines were formed for the charge, but while
doing it we were discovered by the enemy, who immediately opened on us
with shot and shell; but it was too late, the order was at once issued,
“Double-quick, charge!” and we were upon them before they could make any
preparations to receive us, capturing their artillery, and turning their
left completely; we went sweeping down their breast-works, like the
wind, every man yelling at the top of his voice; at the same time that
we charged them on their left, the 6th and 19th corps’ attacked them in
front.

Routed at every point they were soon in wild retreat, the ground being
literally strewn with arms and accoutrements. The cavalry kept up the
pursuit throughout the night, keeping the fleeing army on the jump for
twenty-five miles.

The victory was complete—eleven hundred prisoners and sixteen pieces of
artillery falling into our hands, and accomplished with but very little
loss to us; our regiment losing seven wounded.

We _bivouacked_ on our arms, where darkness overtook us, being
completely tired out with the day’s work. Here occurred one of those
accidents, which, from its sheer needlessness, caused a cold shudder to
run over all. The 34th Massachusetts of our brigade, camped in our
immediate vicinity, and while all was bustle and confusion, their Major,
was shot by the accidental discharge of a musket, at the time, he was
standing with a group of officers around a hastily constructed
camp-fire.

It seemed hard, that after having gallantly and safely passed through so
much hard fighting, thus to be stricken down, while quietly discussing
the day’s battle.

In the morning the army pushed rapidly forward, leaving our brigade to
collect the debris, care for the prisoners and wounded and bury the
dead.

At 10 o’clock A. M., on the 24th, we moved on after the army, through
Woodstock, Edinburg and Mt. Jackson, going into camp two miles beyond,
making a twenty-seven mile march; pretty good considering that the
regiment marched on the flank of the train all day, and until 10 o’clock
P. M., through brush, over fences, up and down hills, and sometimes
fording streams, causing every one to feel glad when the order came to
go into camp wherever a good place could be found.

The next morning we went on through New Market, where we wandered around
some over the ground, of our fight here of May 15th. The trees and
fences plainly giving evidence of the terrible musketry fire on that
day. Resuming our march we went on through Harrisonburg, where we found
the army encamped.

While here we made out “Muster and Pay-Rolls,” and straightened up our
papers generally. The regiment had two hundred and fifty eight men, and
four officers for duty, Capt. Chamberlin in command, with Lieutenants
Husted, Bevington and Keyes under him.

On October 4th Lieut. Meiggs, of Gen. Sheridan’s staff, was bushwhacked
while making observations of the roads in our vicinity, in retaliation
for which, Sheridan ordered that every house and barn within five miles
of the murder should be burned to the ground. This order was afterwards
revoked, so far as the little town of Dayton was concerned, which came
within the prescribed limits.

On the 6th of October we again broke camp, and started back down the
valley. Our brigade was in the rear of the infantry, and directly behind
us came the cavalry, who had orders to destroy all barns, stacks of
grain, and everything that could support a Rebel Army. The smoke that
filled the valley as far as we could see to the rear, was conclusive
proof that the order was being executed to the letter.

We reached Cedar Creek on the 11th and went into camp on the east side,
taking our position on the left of the 19th corps, and here we held our
first election, in accordance with the law, allowing soldiers in the
field to vote. Col. Kellogg and Capt. Kellogg came up just in time to
exercise their elective franchise. Capt Chamberlin, who had ably
commanded the regiment since the 15th of September, was now relieved,
and Lieut. Col. Kellogg, assumed command. We were all glad to see his
genial phiz once more for all knew him, the kind, true friend, the brave
and accomplished officer.

We now had six officers in the line for duty, more than at any other
time since the Hunter Raid.

On the 13th our entire regiment went on picket, a portion of the line
being across the creek, when, to the surprise of every one, the enemy
opened fire from a masked battery, and shelled our camp for about two
hours, when the 1st and 3d brigades of our division were sent out to
look into the matter. They soon found the Rebels in strong force, when
orders were sent for the brigades to return, but the Adjutant General,
after having delivered the order to the 3d brigade, had his horse shot
under him, and failing to give the order to our brigade, they kept on
advancing, until they were heavily engaged, and very soon were forced
back, being overpowered by a greatly superior force. Our brigade lost
heavily, Col. Wells, commanding, and his Adjutant General were killed
and left on the field. Our picket-line was now changed to a
skirmish-line, being reinforced by two companies from the 116th O. V. I.
We held our position firmly, and about midnight advanced a half mile,
and found that the Rebels had fallen back. We laid here several days,
doing picket and forage duty, receiving some reinforcements by men
returning from hospitals.

One day one hundred men were called for to go with a forage train. Every
precaution was used, but the Forage Master thought there was no danger,
and staying out of reach of our protecting Springfields, was gobbled up
with one of his wagons by some bushwhackers, and started towards
“Dixie’s Land.”

The rest of the train, well loaded, reached camp about 9 o’clock P. M.,
very tired, having traveled twenty-four miles over mountain roads.

On the 18th of October the regiment, in conjunction with the 11th
Virginia, made a reconnaissance to within a half mile of the enemy’s
camp. We could plainly see them lying around under the trees, but
nothing to indicate the movement that, on the morrow, was to startle the
nation, and shake the army of the Shenandoah to the very centre.

At half past 4 on the morning of October 19th, the regiment was routed
out by a straggling picket fire in our front; the word was passed along
that the enemy were advancing, and the men quietly fell into line along
the breast-work. The other brigades, however, failed to observe the
warning, or were too slow in “falling in.” The Rebels easily turned the
right of our corps, getting over the works with little or no opposition,
many of the men being still asleep in their tents.

Some resistance, however, was made by our brigade, the only one in the
division not surprised; we fell slowly back, the broken ranks of the
other brigades, rallying upon our line; we soon came upon the 19th corps
that, by this time had got into line, and, meeting their first division,
we made a good stand, giving them several well directed volleys, that
checked their advance, but soon being flanked on the left, were
compelled again to give way; here our division commander, Gen. Thoburn,
and his Adjutant General, were killed. A running fight was now kept up
for about four miles, when meeting the 6th corps drawn up in line, with
their artillery in position, the retreat was checked. The 19th corps
took position on their left, our corps joining their’s, with a good body
of cavalry on our left. Up to this hour it had been the darkest day of
our army life; flushed with victory in two great battles within a month,
supposing ourselves invincible against anything in the valley, thus to
be driven almost in a rout from our works, was a little too much for our
philosophy. But now retreat was no longer thought of; Gen. Wright of the
6th corps had our lines well established, and the enemy decidedly
checked, when Gen. Sheridan arrived on the field, he having ridden from
Winchester, “Twenty miles away,” since the battle commenced. New life
seemed at once to animate the whole army. Some slight changes were made
in the line, particularly with the cavalry—when the order was given,
“Forward along the line,” and away we went, with a heavy line of
skirmishers, armed with repeating rifles, supported by strong lines of
infantry, against whose steady and determined advance there was no
resistance. In less than an hour the Rebel horde was flying back over
the ground they had so lately traversed, flushed with success. The
cavalry now swooped down from their positions, on the right and on the
left, and as the enemy’s lines were turned, and in wild retreat, the
scene that ensued along that valley pike beggars description.

It was a grand sight to see that army, lately shattered and stricken
nigh unto annihilation, thus reform their columns and boldly move out to
the charge; in all the battles of the great rebellion, no parallel is
presented. Back through our camps which they had swept in the morning,
the beaten Rebels ran, throwing away their guns and knapsacks, and
everything that in any way impeded their headlong flight.

The cavalry kept up the pursuit for sixteen miles, recapturing all of
our trains, and capturing the greater portion of their’s.

We stacked our muskets behind the works occupied in the morning, and
slept that night, as we had fought that day, without food.

There is scarce a doubt that if we could have had two hours more of
daylight, the Rebel army would have been totally annihilated, as it was
we captured forty-nine pieces of artillery, besides retaking the ones
taken from us in the morning, and over two-thousand prisoners. Our loss
was very heavy, being over six-thousand in killed and wounded; that of
the enemy being much less. The loss in our regiment was one killed,
fifteen wounded and thirteen missing.

The change from the gloom of disaster that hung over our army in the
morning, to complete and undisputed victory in the evening, cannot
easily be described. The rebellion for this portion of the confederacy
was effectually closed. And when we remember the armies, great and
small, that have at different times marched up and down this famous
valley; the many hard fought battles for the mastery of its soil; its
importance in the great drama of the rebellion is plain. Here the sons
of nearly every State in the Union are sleeping the last long sleep:
some in burial places set apart for their repose, while many, many more,
quietly rest in unmarked and forgotten graves, the victims of a wicked,
cruel and uncalled for attempt upon the life of the purest and best
government upon the face of the earth.

We encamped at night upon our old ground, but without tents, blankets or
rations, the Rebels having made clean work of our camp, and as most of
the men left their haversacks where they grasped their muskets, but very
few had anything to eat, though fighting hard from five in the morning
till seven at night has a tendency to make one hungry.

We changed our camp the next morning to a more sheltered one; anything
but refreshed from our sleep on the cold, damp ground.

In the course of a few days we drew blankets, overcoats and some tents.
Some of the officers rigged up quarters from pieces of old tents, wagon
covers and old boards, not especially handsome; but they answered to
write in, and after a great battle there was always plenty of that to
do. It was an army saying that the trouble in fixing up papers after a
great defeat was only exceeded by that occasioned by a great victory.

We remained here for some time, doing nothing, as there was nothing to
do. The valley was absolutely ours.

On the 28th, the army was paid off, and of course money was plenty, much
to the satisfaction of the suttlers, as well as the boys.

On November 9th we moved back to near Kearnstown, about five miles from
Winchester. It was here that “Little Phil” received his Major-General’s
commission in the United States Army, just one month previous he having
received a Brigadier-General’s commission in the same, winning the one
at Winchester, September 19th, and the other at Cedar Creek, October
19th.

On the 16th of November we had dress-parade for the first time since May
1st. Over six months of hard field service, in which there was no room
for parade or drill. We had borne our part in the engagements at New
Market, Piedmont, Lynchburg, Snicker’s Ferry, Winchester, Berryville,
Opequan, Fisher’s Hill, and Cedar Creek, losing forty in killed,
ninety-seven in wounded and twenty-four missing. Of officers we had one
killed and four wounded, being one-half the number we had for duty at
any one time. We had marched eleven hundred miles, and for the most part
under a broiling sun and on short rations.

On the 18th, our brigade was ordered to Opequan bridge, to guard the
railroad at that point, where, on the 24th, we received our portion of
the ten thousand Thanksgiving turkeys, sent by our noble State to her
sons in the field. While remaining here it rained the most of the time,
the weather being quite cold.

December 14th, Adjutant McCracken returned to the regiment, and on the
17th, the officers of the brigade, with the band of the 34th
Massachusetts came over to our headquarters, and a general good time was
indulged in. Not, perhaps, in strict accordance with the views of the
would-be reformers of this day, but, nevertheless, all were happy; every
one was congratulated on being alive, and fair fortune was invoked to
continue propitious for each and every one. We had now made preparations
for remaining here during the winter. The men had built good quarters
out of logs, procured from the woods near at hand, and the officers had
erected quite a house from similar material, when, on December 18th,
orders came transferring our division to the army of the James, in front
of Richmond.




                             CHAPTER VIII.
FROM OPEQUAN BRIDGE TO THE SURRENDER OF LEE, INCLUDING HATCHER’S RUN AND
                              HIGH BRIDGE.


On the 19th of December we left our log cabins so laboriously
constructed, with some regrets, and possibly with some hard words, but a
soldier’s life is one of obedience, and, in a few hours, our nice
quarters at Opequan were forgotten, and we were ready to build others as
uncomplainingly as we had these, wherever our camp would be pitched. It
was a drizzly, cold day, and for some unknown reason we were very slow
in getting started.

But at length, about 2 o’clock P. M., we were all on board the cars and
on our way to Washington, where we arrived early the next morning. In
about two hours we embarked on board the steamer Keyport and started
down the Potomac.

We sailed under sealed orders, not knowing for a certainty where we were
going until after passing Fortress Monroe, though our destination had
been pretty well guessed.

We experienced very rough weather while on the voyage, and a great many
of the men were sea-sick, and we were compelled to anchor for the night
off the Rhappahannock river, the steamer having four feet of water in
the hold. It was a disgrace to our country thus to jeopardize the lives
of men. We, of course, had no option in the matter; on this vessel we
were to sail and that ended the matter; if the steamer had gone to the
bottom with us—and it was a wonder that she did not—the verdict would
have been as usual—a terrible loss of life, and no one to blame. But
this was only one of ten thousand cases, where the men who were in the
field, nobly battling for the nation’s life, suffered through the wicked
greed of gain in others.

On the 22d we got under-way early in the day, passing Fortress Monroe on
the right and “Rip Raps” on the left.

The angry waves dashing against their sides on that icy December
morning, caused them to appear anything but inviting spots to us,
accustomed to soldiering among green hills and grassy hillsides.

Early the next morning we disembarked at Jones Landing, near City Point,
and marched about five miles in a northerly direction, taking our
position in the line on the right of the 24th corps, to which we were
now attached as the independent division, Gen. John W. Turner
commanding.

We passed a cold and sleepless night, there being about four inches of
snow on the ground, and wood very scarce.

Our train did not get up until nearly morning. The next morning we went
to work on our camp in good earnest. From a wood, about a half mile
distant, the men split out slabs and carried them, on their shoulders,
notching them together in regular backwoods style, covering them with
their “dog-tents,” making houses large enough to accommodate from six to
eight men.

They then built a fire place in each out of sticks laid up in cob-house
fashion, plastering heavily with clay both on the inside and outside,
and made ourselves quite comfortable for the winter.

The weather was very disagreeable all through the months of January and
February, raining or snowing nearly every day, keeping us in slush
nearly all the time. Firing was constantly going on at the front, and
during the day hearing cannonading was the regular order, but no general
engagement occurred during the winter. While here inspections were quite
frequent, and very rigid, and great pains were taken with the appearance
and discipline of the regiment. We were under arms and at the
breast-works every morning at daybreak. Many promotions were made during
the winter, Capt. Chamberlin to Major, 1st Lieutenants Davis, McCracken,
Snyder and Bevington to Captains, and 2d Lieutenants Husted, Pumphrey,
Sowers and Keyes to 1st Lieutenants. The last being soon after detailed
on brigade staff.

Captains Randolph, Rosenbaum and Robbins, and Lieutenants Davis, Acker
and Boyce, joined the regiment, they having made their escape from
“Rebel prisons” during the fall and winter, this being the first we had
seen of them since the disastrous fight at Winchester, June 15th, 1863.

Sometime in March we received a new stand of colors, our old ones being
completely in ribbons, and Major Chamberlin going home on a leave of
absence, took them with him to Ohio, and presented them to the Governor
for safe keeping.

About the middle of March everything began to assume a busy air
throughout the army, and it was evident that military movements would
soon begin.

On the 25th our division received orders to be ready to move at an hours
notice, and on the night of the 27th the orders came, and very shortly
we were on the way, crossing the James River under cover of the
darkness. We then struck off to the rear of our works for a short
distance, and then away towards our left. All night long through that
dense woods and pitchy darkness we slowly picked our way. The road was
very muddy, and the march a tiresome one. We halted about 4 o’clock in
the morning for a short rest.

Snatching a hasty breakfast at 8 o’clock, we were again on the road,
pushing on all day towards the left. We now became aware that Sheridan
was pressing the enemy’s right, and that we were probably on the way to
reinforce him.

On the morning of the 29th we reached the position assigned us in the
vicinity of Hatcher’s Run, and remained quietly behind the works until
the next day.

Early in the morning we moved out beyond the entrenchments, and
immediately the crack of musketry announced that skirmishing had begun,
but we steadily pressed them back, through the tangled woods and across
creeks and gullies. About noon the rain commenced falling in torrents,
making our advance very tedious.

We stopped at night, and at once commenced fortifying our position. All
next day the rain continued to pour, making it impossible for us to move
our artillery, and we were compelled to remain idle. Early on the 31st
our division moved out to the attack, the regiment being on the skirmish
line, were immediately under fire, and drove the enemy steadily back
until within five hundred yards of their entrenched position on
Hatcher’s Run. Just before a halt was ordered, the regiment made a
gallant charge, driving the Rebs from a point of timber, capturing some
prisoners and gaining a very desirable position and maintained it
against a heavy cannonade and musketry fire throughout the day. As soon
as night came on, we set to work building breast works, using rails and
loose stones, and digging dirt with our bayonets, we were very soon
pretty strongly entrenched. We remained there all night, getting very
little, if any, sleep. Firing commenced early in the morning and was
kept up steadily through the day, no change, however, being made in our
position. Now by all reason of fairness we certainly should have been
relieved. We had been on severe duty for two days, sending many of our
dead and wounded back to the rear, amply attesting the work we had done.
We had cooked nothing to eat during the time, though the boys in the
rear had sent us out hot coffee on several occasions. But Gen. Turner
sent a special request to Col. Kellogg, who had gallantly and in person
commanded the line; asking that he remain with his regiment, on the
line, for another night. Of course his request was complied with.

At day-break the grand movement was made along the whole line, that gave
us Petersburg, and sent the Rebels broken and shattered from their last
stronghold in Virginia.

The advance was begun on our right, and as the cheers of our troops
announced their success, Col. Kellogg became very anxious to lead his
regiment against the works in our front. Twice he sent for permission
before it came.

The regiment was all ready, and at the word, leaped over their rail pens
and away for the enemies works, and without a stop, over their defences,
capturing several hundred prisoners, two cannon and two battle flags.
One of these battle flags is still in possession of Col. Kellogg, at
Norwalk, and the other is deposited with our own colors at the Capital.

After our division had forced their lines at Hatcher’s Run, we joined
our corps, and pressing on after the 6th corps, swerving to the right
and closing in on the enemy around Petersburg. Just at night, our
division was selected by Gen. Gibbon, to carry by storm two large forts
on the South of the city.

We were soon formed in column by brigade, with our brigade in front.
Company D, now the brigade sharpshooters, were deployed in front. At the
order, our three brigades sprang forward to the charge at a right
shoulder shift; the sharpshooters opened a rapid fire that was so well
directed, that their guns were used with very poor effect. Without a
stop the first fort was reached, and after ten or fifteen minutes of
desperate resistance was ours. The second one then fell with scarce a
struggle.

The roar of battle was now heard along the whole line, the enemy
fighting bravely behind their works; but at the close of that Sabbath
evening we knew that the strength of the Rebellion was broken.

During the night Petersburg and Richmond was evacuated, and the Rebel
army in rapid retreat towards Danville. Early in the morning we were in
pursuit, taking the road towards Burkesville, along the South Side road.
Gen. Ord being in command of our portion of the army. We marched to
Burkesville, arriving there at 11 o’clock on the night of the 5th, being
square on Lee’s flank, who was to the north of us and on the road
towards Farmville. The army was completely jaded, having been on the
march since early morning, and rest was imperatively demanded. The
General, however, called for two picked regiments to go out and destroy
the bridges that cross the Appomattox, near Farmville, and thus cut off
the enemy’s retreat in that direction. The 123d Ohio and 54th
Pennsylvania were selected, and with a squadron of the 4th Massachusetts
cavalry, the whole under command of Gen. Theodore Read, at once started.
They met the head of Lee’s army near the point designated, and at once
bravely attacked them.

Col. Kellogg was in command of the infantry, Gen. Read being away with
the cavalry on a reconnaissance.

Deploying a heavy line of skirmishers, we stubbornly maintained our
position, though against a largely superior force. After having repulsed
them several times, Gen. Read, knowing we could not long withstand their
rapidly increasing force, resolved to charge with his little band of
cavalry, and endeavor to cut his way through to the main army. Gallantly
that squadron rode to the assault, many of them destined never again to
hear the bugle’s call. The brave Read was killed, and eleven officers of
his staff and cavalry killed or wounded.

None of them succeeded in getting through, nor did any of them return to
us. Still we held our ground, and as the Rebels marched out beyond our
flanks, more men were deployed, until finally, both regiments were a
mere skirmish line. For several hours this unequal contest was waged,
till at last the boys began to get out of ammunition, and very soon that
cry became general.

Col. Kellogg, who had been hoping all along that the army would come to
his rescue, now saw there was no use longer to resist, and ordered the
line to fall back slowly and in as good order as possible, thinking that
some of the command, at least, might escape through the woods.

But as soon as they saw our line breaking back, they swooped down upon
us in great force, and in few moments both regiments were prisoners. We
lost a good many men in this engagement. Capt. Randolph was shot through
the breast by a cavalryman, after having surrendered.

This gallant little fight of these two regiments received honorable
mention by Gen. Grant, in his report of the war. He says that their
brave and stubborn resistance at this point, checked Lee’s retreat long
enough to enable Gen. Ord to get up with his main force, compelling Lee
to intrench himself, thus causing great delay in the enemy’s movements.

The regiment, or so many of them as did not make their escape after
their capture, remained prisoners until Lee’s surrender at Appomattox
Court House—a period of two days—but time enough for the Rebels to “go
through” our boys, stripping them of everything valuable, taking even
their hats and shoes. In striking contrast to the treatment they
received at our hands after their surrender, when scarcely a Reb was
allowed to start on his homeward tramp without a well-filled haversack
and canteen.

The regiment at once came back to the division, but in the treaty agreed
upon, being counted as paroled prisoners, were ordered to report at
Parole Camp, Annapolis as such.

The Rebel Army of Northern Virginia had surrendered. And on that quiet
Sabbath evening as the lightning flashed the intelligence from city to
hamlet, the church bells rang out the glad tidings over the free North,
and the Nation thanked the God of battles that the end for which we had
suffered and struggled so long, had come. For four long years had these
two mighty armies met in conflict and contested for the mastery.

Their dead lie all along the valley from the Potomac to Lynchburg; they
are sleeping where they fell, at Antietam and Gettysburg, on the heights
of Fredericksburgh, and through the dark thickets of the Wilderness.
They lie in the dark forests’ of the Peninsula all the way up to Deep
Bottom, and around Petersburg. Along the tangled morass near Hatcher’s
Run, and the Weldon Road, their graves mark the fierce conflict. Brave
Old Army of the Potomac, long suffering, gallantly fighting, your reward
has come; never again will the boasted army of Northern Virginia meet
you in equal conflict; yours is the victory and “fairly won.”




                              CHAPTER IX.
                 FROM HATCHER’S RUN TO THE MUSTER-OUT.


On the 12th of April the regiment left Appomattox for Burkesville
Junction, the road was filled with “Johnnies” on their way home, and the
greater portion of them were heartily glad that the war was over, even
though they had to see the flag of the lost cause folded forever.

The next morning we left the Junction on board a train of freight cars
for City Point, fifty-two miles distant. At that place we first learned
of the assassination of President Lincoln. It excited the most profound
grief among all to hear of his death, and in such a manner, just at the
close, as it were, of the Great Rebellion. At first it seemed as though
it was impossible for us to realize the truth of the report; but it
being confirmed by the War Department, we were reluctantly compelled to
believe it.

Our men were all greatly elated over the surrender of Lee and the
probable termination of the war; which fact only seemed to cause a
greater revulsion of feeling at the news of the death of our now
lamented President. If he could have been permitted to witness the final
end of the great struggle through which we were passing, in which we
were endeavoring to sustain the power of our Republican form of
Government, and preserve our free institutions; how gratifying it would
have been to all concerned. But this was not to be. Nevertheless he
passed away, “With malice toward none, but charity toward all.”

Just after leaving Burkesville we met Capt. Chamberlin returning to the
regiment from leave of absence, and Maj. Walker, Paymaster, who was on
his way to the front to pay the troops in our division.

At City Point the regiment embarked on a steamer for Annapolis, arriving
there during the forenoon of the 17th, going into quarters at College
Green Barracks, where clothing was issued to the men, and they got
cleaned up and rested; and on the 21st, in pursuance of orders received
to report at Camp Chase, we were loaded on a train of box cars, and
started for Ohio by the way of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. We moved
very slowly, not exceeding eight miles an hour, passing Martinsburg on
the 22d, Grafton on the 23d, Bellaire and Zanesville on the 24th,
reaching Columbus at 9 o’clock P. M. that night. We went into quarters
at Tod Barracks, and the next day we marched to Camp Chase, where we
remained some time, awaiting the order for “muster out.”

On the 29th President Lincoln’s funeral cortege reached Columbus, on its
way to Springfield, Illinois. One hundred and fifty men of our regiment
were detailed as guard at the State House, while his remains were lying
there in state. All day long a constant procession was filing through
the State House, to take a last view of our “departed Lincoln.”

The officers were now busy preparing Muster-Rolls, and on the 30th the
regiment was mustered.

While in camp here, many of the officers and men visited their homes,
all very anxious for the day of our Muster-out to arrive.

On the 31st of May, it having been decided that we could no longer be
considered paroled prisoners, arms were again issued to the men. This
they objected to strongly, fearing that it was only a prelude to an
order for duty at some other point; and now, that the war was over, the
regiment preferred going home to playing soldier at some post.

Finally, on the 2d of June, a telegram was received from the War
Department, ordering the 123d to be Mustered-out as soon as the
necessary Rolls could be prepared.

Oh the 12th, the rolls having been completed and examined by the
mustering officer, discharges filled out and signed, Company’s A, B, C,
E, and G were mustered out and paid, and before night nearly all of them
were on their way home. The remainder of the regiment was mustered out
on the following day, and left for home; Lieutenant H. Latimer Beck,
13th U. S. Infantry was the mustering officer. Thus, in a few moments,
as it were, the ties that for three years had bound us together, were
sundered. And while in each breast the heart throbs were beating to the
music of “Home, Sweet Home;” thronging memories came trooping up from
the past, of the manly forms who went with us to the field and fell by
the wayside, of those who wasted in hospitals, or in Rebel Prison Pens.
Alas! for them, the home circle must continue to mourn. And as gathered
in groups about the camp to say the last good-bye; manly tears would
come for those who were of our number once, but were now borne on the
grand “muster-roll” in that other camping-ground.

During our three years of service, the regiment had marched two-thousand
one hundred and eighty-four miles, had traveled by rail one thousand
five hundred and thirty-one miles, and by boat one thousand and
seventeen miles. Making a grand total of five thousand seven hundred and
thirty-two miles.

The regiment, besides participating in many skirmishes in the valley of
minor importance, were in the following general engagements:

Winchester, June 13th, 14th and 15th, ’63; New Market, May 15th, ’64;
Piedmont, June 5th, ’64; Lynchburg, June 17th and 18th, ’64; Snicker’s
Ford, July 19th, ’64; Winchester, July 24th, ’64; Berryville, September
3d, ’64; Opequan, September 19th, ’64; Fisher’s Hill, September 22d,
’64; Cedar Creek, October 19th, ’64; Petersburg and Hatcher’s Run, from
March 30th to April 2d, ’65, and High Bride or Farmville, April 6th,
’65, a record of which any regiment may well be proud.




                               CHAPTER X.
  PRISON LIFE FROM THE DIARY OF A CAPTAIN IN THE 123D OHIO VOLUNTEERS.


After our surrender on the morning of June 15th, 1863, to Col. Walker,
commanding the famous “Old Stonewall Brigade,” we were taken to where
the morning fight had taken place, and were permitted to lie down and
rest. After remaining there a couple of hours we were marched into
Winchester, halting there a few moments, and were then taken over to the
Fort. A couple of tents were then put up for the accommodation of the
commissioned officers, but which failed to prevent the wind from
annoying us very much by blowing sand in from all directions. Wearied
and worn out, and having eaten nothing during the day, we were compelled
to lie down at night without even a “hard-tack” to refresh us. Next
morning, about 9 o’clock, a few pounds of meat was distributed among us,
shortly after which the officers were separated from the enlisted men
and marched over to the Court House. Late in the evening we received
some bread and meat, but previously, Capt. Chamberlin had received a
basket of provisions kindly tendered by some good Union loving Quaker
ladies of the city, which he distributed among our officers, and for
which they will ever hold those ladies in grateful remembrance. The
officers remained there until 4 o’clock P. M., of the following day,
when they were drawn up in line, the roll called, and after being
supplied with blankets, our party, consisting of one hundred and eight
commissioned officers, started on our march to Richmond, under charge of
Capt. Wingfield, 58th Va. (Confederate), and his company. That evening
we marched eleven miles, and laid down on the ground for the night about
10 o’clock. Thursday we marched twelve miles, lying by for three or four
hours in the middle day, when flour and meat were issued to us, and we
set to work baking up our flour into cakes. The men overtook us here,
but we were not allowed to communicate with them. It rained heavily in
the afternoon, completely drenching us through, and at night we were
obliged to take up our quarters in an old log stable, which was more
thoroughly invested by fleas than was particularly pleasant or
convenient to us. Wet as we were, we laid down and attempted to gain a
few hours repose, but alas, no chance for that desired boon. All night
long the inhabitants of the stable could be heard visiting their
maledictions on the fleas. The next day we marched nineteen miles to Mt.
Jackson, and took up our quarters for the night in the Rebel hospital
buildings. On Saturday we marched sixteen miles to Lincoln Springs,
where we had a pleasant place to camp for the night. On Sunday we
marched twenty-one miles. Col. Wilson, Adjt. Blair, Capt. Rings, Capt.
Chamberlin and Lieut. Pumphrey, about noon hired a man, with a one horse
wagon, to haul them to Staunton, a distance of twenty-three miles, for
which privilege each of them paid five dollars in Confederate money.
And, if the man could have carried them, he would have had more
passengers at the same price.

On Monday noon we reached Staunton and remained there two hours, and
then took the cars for Richmond, a distance of one hundred and
thirty-six miles, which we passed over during the night, arriving at our
destination about six o’clock A. M., June 23d. We were immediately
marched to the Libby Prison, where we were searched, and our rubber
coats, blankets, etc. taken from us. The most of us managed to secrete
our money, so that it was not discovered. They gave receipts for the
money they did get, which _assured_ us that it would be _returned_ to us
when released. The officials informed us we could draw it as we needed
it; which, afterwards, proved to be anything but true. They even went so
far as to take a few sheets of paper and envelopes from one of our
officers.

We were then taken up stairs, and introduced to our new quarters. The
“Hotel de Libby,” as it was afterwards facetiously called, is a large
brick building, one hundred and fifty feet in length by one hundred and
five feet in depth. It fronted on Cary and extended back to Canal
street, immediately in the rear of which was the canal and James river.
This building was, previous to the war, occupied by Libby & Son, who
carried on in it their business as ship-chandlers and grocers.
Internally, it much resembled an Ohio grain ware-house, being three
stories high, with a basement story underneath, and divided into three
tiers of rooms. The lower room of the first tier was occupied by the
various officers engaged in the control of the Prison. The two upper
rooms were, at the time of our arrival, used for the confinement of
prisoners, and we found there Col. Streight’s command and a few others,
amounting to thirteen hundred and sixty officers. Of the middle tier,
one room was occupied by citizen prisoners and deserters from the Union
army. The third tier was used as a hospital for Union officers. The
basement contained a couple of cells, for the close confinement of
prisoners; the remainder of it was devoted to the use of the slaves
employed about the premises. _The attaches_ of the Prison were as
follows: Capt. Turner, commandant; Lieut. Latonche, his assistant, and,
by-the-way, the most obliging official we had anything to do
with—Inspector Turner being one of the most tyrannical beings that ever
lived, and had been a horse-jockey in one of the Northern cities
previous to the war; Ross, who attended to the roll, and was a deserter
from the North; George, (a sergeant) under lackey, whose duty it was to
communicate orders to the prisoners; and Charley, a mulatto, who
superintended the gang of darkies in their labors. When we entered
Libby, the upper one of the two rooms in which we were placed contained
bunks, sufficient for those who were then in the Prison, while they used
the lower one for cooking and eating purposes.

We were obliged to take up our residence in the lower room and sleep on
the floor at nights and use it to sit on in the day time, as we had no
other seats furnished except stationary benches, at the tables.

Shortly after taking up our lodgings there, we applied for some of our
money, but we met with the reply that none of “the officers of Milroy’s
command could have a d—d cent.” Nor did we get any from them until the
1st of October. We were also informed that we would not be allowed to
purchase anything outside—as Straight’s command was then permitted to
do—so we had to smuggle our purchases through them for some time, until
their orders were tacitly countermanded.—During the first four weeks,
while subsisting on the rations furnished, we were often glad to pick up
crumbs from the table to satisfy our hunger.

In speaking of the attaches of the prison, Gen. Johnson, a gentleman of
color, should be mentioned, although he was a prisoner, as well as
ourselves. His duty consisted in supplying us with smoke, which he did
every morning, carrying a skillet of burning tar through the rooms,
crying “Here’s your nice smoke, without money or price.” He also
collected the soiled clothes once a week, which he was permitted to take
out to be washed, returning them Sunday mornings, at the small charge of
three pieces for one dollar. He also, for some time, monopolized the
shaving and hair cutting, which operations he performed at the moderate
price of twenty-five cents for the former and seventy-five cents for the
latter; but he was finally superseded by an enterprising German
Lieutenant, which compelled him to abandon this calling and take to that
of “boot-black.” The old fellow was a regular fixture there, having been
in the Prison about two years. He was an old soldier also, having
accompanied a Pennsylvania regiment through the Mexican war. Every
morning at nine o’clock A. M. “George” made his appearance, and, with
his peculiar intonation of voice, would cry out: “Fall in, sick, and go
down;” when those who wished to be prescribed for would huddle together
and go down on the first floor, where they were examined by the
surgeon—who was spoken of as a kind and attentive physician—and, after
making a minute of their cases, would send them back to their rooms,
excepting those whom it was deemed necessary to send to the hospital. In
the course of two or three hours, the medicine would be brought up and
distributed to the sick.

Our enlisted men, prisoners of war who were so unfortunate as to become
sick, suffered outrageously. They were often allowed to lie in their
tents on Belle Isle, on the wet ground, until the last moment, when they
would be brought over to the hospital to breath their last.

If a description of the truth would be fit for publication, some few
particular cases could be cited that would make any one shudder to think
that there were, in this day and age of the world, men who were so lost
to all feeling of humanity as to permit men, although their enemies, to
languish and die through sufferings such as no pen should be called upon
to describe.

Once a squad of Yankees (prisoners) were leaving the Libby building with
a supply of the “so-called” rations for the prisoners. It consisted of
weak soup—better say soiled water—in old, dirty pails, and about six
ounces of poor bread per man. We threw a few apples to them from the
windows, which they received gladly and began to eat as if they were
nearly starved.

The “Libby Burlesque Troupe,” as they announced in their programme
Saturday morning, October 17th, 1863, appeared for the last time that
evening, owing to their having an engagement in Washington, for which
purpose they expected to leave on the next “Flag of Truce Boat.” They
exhibited to a crowd of Yankees with one or two Rebels included. The
performances were very good, considering the impromptu manner in which
they were gotten up. They consisted of songs, dances and the reading of
the “Libby Ironical,” which was a burlesque on the “Libby Chronicle,”
the weekly issue of which had been read the forenoon previous.

During the hot weather of July and August, the variety displayed in the
costume of the inmates of the Prison, was decidedly laughable. Here you
would see a man with nothing but drawers and shirt on, there one with
drawers minus the shirt, while close by was another with the shirt minus
the drawers, and then another one with nothing on but a linen coat
(Raglan style), his clothes being out washing, no doubt. This style of
dress was very comfortable during that kind of weather, but when the
cold days of October came, it was rather unpleasant to be _compelled_ to
go around without socks or drawers and only one shirt, which valuable
article we were obliged to dispense with occasionally for the purpose of
having them washed. We had blankets enough during the warm weather, but
when the cold nights set in, it was discovered that while some had an
abundant supply, others had only one, and many had none at all. Repeated
complaints having been made to the Rebel officials, Inspector Turner
made his appearance one Sunday morning and proceeded to make a division
of the house, putting prisoners in one room and blankets in the other.
He then gave to each man as he passed back into the room, two old
blankets (U. S.), but the supply not being sufficient to go around, the
remainder of the men had to go without, and on application to the
authorities we were informed that they had no more, and consequently
could give us no more. The bedding and clothing furnished to our sick in
the hospital was supplied by the United States Sanitary Commission.

The principal topic of conversation and excitement in Libby was the
“Exchange Question.” When we first made our advent in that highly
popular institution, it was certainly thought that we would not possibly
remain longer than ten days or two weeks. But at the end of that time we
were still there, the Commissioners not having met; “but just as soon as
they do meet we will be exchanged sure, and go home by the first Truce
boat.” In this manner we consoled ourselves in our misfortune. Well, the
Commissioners met, but did not agree. And the Rebel authorities then
published a statement, that they had made a proposition to our
Government, which was so plausible on its face that we thought it would
be immediately accepted, as a matter of course, but something intervened
to prevent the exchange. And so it went on, first one rumor and then
another; first would come the report that the surgeons and chaplains
were going to leave on the next boat, and the officers were to follow
immediately; this statement would be directly succeeded by the report
that the Commissioners had disagreed and there would be no more
exchanges during the war. The next report would come from the hospital,
to the effect that a clerk in the War Department had just been to see a
friend there and told him that a boat was up, and that the chaplains and
some of the officers would be exchanged. And so on without end, each day
bringing some new sensation relative to the exchange question, and each
one without foundation. Upon the arrival of any of these statements it
would be followed by the vociferous cries of “get ready,” “pack up,”
“pack up,” from all parts of the house, while the inmates would soon
gather in crowds to discuss the correctness of the report. One would be
certain of its truth, for it came from a reliable gentleman; the next
would be a little doubtful, while the third one declared he would hardly
believe we were exchanged even if Capt. Turner should come up himself
and announce the fact.

Lieut. Flick, for an attempt to bribe the guard and escape, was taken
out and confined in the cell for some three weeks, then released and
sent back among the officers.

When we first entered Libby we could exchange our _greenbacks_ for
Confederate trash at the rate of two dollars of the latter for one of
the former. In a short time they began to increase in value, until we
were able to get seven and a half Confederate for one of Federal, at
which rate it ranged for a long time. At first the exchange of money was
conducted through the sentinel stationed on guard at the stairway, but
two or three having been arrested for so doing, put a stop to that
manner of transacting business and another, but less dangerous, plan was
adopted. One hundred dollars in greenbacks would be raised and sent out
by one of the negro boys belonging to the establishment, who would
exchange it with some citizen, and bring us back seven hundred and fifty
dollars in Confederate rags, which was the only kind of currency we
could use in the purchase of provisions.

The following is the list of officers from our regiment who were
captured at Winchester and confined in Libby: Col. W. T. Wilson, Lt.
Col. H. B. Hunter, Adjt. Blair, Capts. Riggs, Caldwell, Robbins,
Rosenbaum, Randolph, Bender and Chamberlin; Lieuts. Davis, Smith,
Bevington, Schuyler, Pumphrey, Breckenridge, Sowers, Colver, Williams,
Acker and Boyce, making twenty-one in all. The enlisted men were taken
to Belle Isle, confined there about three weeks, when they were paroled
and sent North.

On October 7th, the chaplains were aroused early in the morning, marched
to the boat, and then taken down the James river to City Point, where
they met the Flag of Truce boat, and went North. They were all very much
elated, except Chaplain McCabe, of the 123d Ohio, who, on account of
poor health, was obliged to wait for the next boat.

On the 11th a meeting of the Ohio and Pennsylvania officers was held for
the purpose of making the necessary arrangements preparatory to holding
our election. On the 13th election was held. At the Pennsylvania polls
Curtin received a large majority. And at the Ohio polls one hundred and
sixty-three votes were cast—one hundred and sixty-two for Brough and one
for Jewett. Three Ohio officers refused to vote.

On the 16th we were notified by the Rebel authorities that they would
only furnish us twenty-five dollars—Confederate—per month out of our
money in their possession. This amount would not have furnished potatoes
for one week, at the rate we were paying for them, but as we were under
Rebel authority, we of course, had to submit.

Furnished with only a limited supply of Government rations, money taken
from us, and only allowed in such small sums that it really amounted to
nothing, caused us to think that perhaps they meant to starve us.
Richmond daily papers were constantly complaining about their government
feeding so many Yankees there; and one paper advised the authorities to
confiscate the boxes of clothing and provisions that were sent us by our
friends in the North.

On the 19th the Right Rev. Bishop Magill (Roman Catholic) preached to
the officers in Libby. On the 20th quite a large number of boxes, for
officers, from their friends in the North, arrived and were distributed.
A few greenbacks were ingeniously concealed in some of the boxes and,
fortunately, escaped the search of the examing officers. Notices were
posted, informing us that there would be, hereafter, roll-call twice a
day—at 7:30 A. M. and 5:00 P. M.—and that five minutes would be allowed
each time to “fall in;” officers not in line then “would be punished
accordingly.” Also, that if “spitting on the floor” and “throwing apple
cores in the spit-boxes” were not stopped, the purchase of tobacco and
apples would be prohibited. We received letters from the regiment on the
21st, being the first since we were captured.

The Rebels had some sugar in hogsheads, stored in the ware-house, nearly
opposite the Libby, where some of our enlisted men were confined. The
men were in the second story, the sugar in the first. On the 24th it was
discovered that the sugar had been too tempting for the boys, and that
they had appropriated some seven or eight hogsheads to their own use,
amounting to some twenty thousand dollars of their money. As a matter of
course, the remainder was immediately moved out of the reach of the
half-starved Yankees.

On the 25th a letter was found, purporting to be from a Michigan surgeon
to Capt. Turner, asking for a blanket, in which he stated that, under
other circumstances, he would rather be a friend to the South than an
enemy. A drum-head court-martial was immediately convened, the culprit
brought forward, and confronted with the letter. It appeared, on
examination, that he was guilty of writing the letter, but that he was a
loyal man and, suffering very much for the want of a blanket, had taken
this method to procure one. He was permitted to go unmolested, as he had
not succeeded in his attempt to deceive our _humane_ captors.

Maj. Huston, who had been in the hospital for some time, and was a
tailor by trade, was employed by the Rebel surgeon to repair his uniform
for him, which he did, but, when completed, instead of giving it to the
surgeon, donned the uniform himself and, about dusk, he quietly walked
out, passing himself off as the surgeon. He succeeded in passing the
guards without any difficulty.

This escape so alarmed the Rebels that they took possession of the lower
east room, again locating the officers’ hospital in that room, nailed up
the door between that and the upper rooms, giving us the possession of
the lower, middle room, after taking the precaution to nail up the
windows and double the guard on the outside of the building. For nearly
forty-eight hours after the sick and wounded officers were brought to
the building, the Rebels neither furnished them with rations nor
blankets, but after dark, communication was opened with them, and they
were furnished with blankets by us and a portion of our eatables.

About midnight of the 25th a gun was fired by one of the guards, at
which signal—premeditated no doubt, as no one was attempting to
escape—there immediately assembled in front of the prison two companies
of infantry and a small crowd of men with a howitzer. This was done very
promptly, no doubt with the intention of intimidating us Yankees inside.

On the 26th we were put on bread and water. The reason assigned for this
was the breaking open of the door into the hospital, but, most probably,
the reason was the want of meat to furnish us with.

During the last of this month the weather was very severe, our officers
suffering much from the cold. We were allowed little or no fire, and the
windows having no glass in them, the zephyrs had free access. Many of us
had no underclothing, a number with only one blanket, and some without
any. One morning the man “George,” without any provocation, drew a
revolver on one of the officers, when Lieut. Reed, 3rd Ohio, a wounded
officer, told him he must not attempt that here. For this offence (?)
Reed was taken down to the cell and kept there three days, the first
night without any blanket whatever.

On the 29th of October some forty boxes and bales, from the Sanitary and
Christian Commissions, were received at Libby; also, about one hundred
and fifty private boxes, for officers. The boxes from the Sanitary
Commission were consigned to Gen. Dow, consisting of shirts, drawers,
socks, handkerchiefs, and blankets. Those from the Christian Commission
were consigned to Lieut. Randolph, 5th U. S. Artillery, the contents
consisting of underclothing, reading matter, hams and liquors, the
latter, no doubt, for hospital purposes. The articles were, probably, as
well distributed as could be expected under the circumstances, excepting
the hams and liquors, which were monopolized by a very few.

On the 30th of October we learned that nine men, belonging to our
regiment, were still on Belle Isle, some of them wounded and all
suffering very much.

On November 2d, some of the officers received money from the Rebel
authorities at the rate of five dollars Confederate for one of
greenbacks. A large number of private boxes also arrived and the next
day were distributed; six for the officers of the regiment, one of them
from the sutler. So many boxes were arriving at this time that they were
examined very briefly; the principal object of the search being to
ascertain whether there was any liquor concealed in them. Both money and
lengthy letters were frequently so ingeniously concealed as to elude
even a close scrutiny. They were usually secreted in cans of fruit or
butter, and occasionally a can of whisky would pass labelled “peaches.”

On the 5th Gen. Dow went over to “Belle Isle” and issued to our men,
confined there, the clothing consigned to his care by our Government. He
reported their condition to be very destitute indeed, many being
compelled to sleep on the bare ground without any shelter over them.
This sort of treatment, in the dead of winter and on a sandy island in
the James river, was simply barbarous.

On the 7th a class in sword exercise was organized, and for a few days
nothing but the resounding clash of _sticks_, and the various commands
were heard. But the novelty of the thing soon wore away, and this, like
every amusement gotten up to while away our lonesome hours, was soon
dropped.

Large numbers of boxes arrived daily, their contents being distributed
to the boys on “Belle Isle,” by Union officers designated for that
purpose.

Gen. Dow occasionally entertained us with a lecture on—his favorite
topic—Temperance. Corn bread was our regular rations; the Rebel
authorities said they had nothing else to give us.

November 8th the Rev. Dr. McCabe, of the city, preached to us in the
afternoon, and the minstrels performed in the evening. A gun was fired
by one of the guards during the night, the alarm given and the whole
guard turned out to repel the expected outbreak, which, after all, was
only a false alarm.

On the 12th the daily papers stated that the surgeons had been
exchanged, whereupon everybody went to work writing long letters to be
secreted on the persons of the fortunate doctors, and in that way get
them smuggled through the “blockade.”

On the 13th several hundred enlisted men were sent to Danville, the
Rebels beginning to fear that there were too many Yankees in and about
the city of Richmond. It did not make much difference to the boys, as
they could hardly be treated any worse than they had been.

On the 14th we had some beef issued to us for the first time in many
days. Corn bread was our staple, and such stuff it was; it looked as
though the meal of which it was composed had been made by grinding the
corn and the cob together, thus utilizing the whole ear. The compound
was baked in large sheets about three feet square and from three-fourths
of an inch to three inches in thickness, and about the solidity of lead.
No one ever attempted to dispute the fact that we received our full
rations of “bread by weight” during those days.

About this time the most exciting topic of conversation was relative to
allowing Rebel ministers of the Gospel to preach to us in Libby. It was
decided, however, to allow them to do so.

On the morning of the 24th the surgeons were notified to be ready to
leave in a few moments, as the Confederate soldiers had arrived; they
were also ordered to disgorge the letters they had concealed about their
persons; only a few of them, however, did so. We afterwards learned that
they were searched down stairs, but with what result we did not learn.

Letters were concealed about their persons in a variety of places; in
the lining of hats, coats, pants and boots, under shoulder straps,
bandaged around sore legs, twisted up in small wads, and carried loosely
in the pockets, concealed in plugs of tobacco, loaves of bread, etc.

Maj. White, 67th Pennsylvania, hired a surgeon to let him go in his
place, which he did. It being afterwards discovered—some Federal officer
having divulged the fact—notice of it was telegraphed to City Point. The
Major was stopped, and we were notified that unless we designated the
surgeon left behind, our rations would be stopped. Some _craven-hearted
coward_ pointed him out. The next day Major White was brought back, but
was not punished.

And such was life in Libby. It was not safe to trust any-one, save your
most intimate friends and acquaintances. Volumes might be written of the
brave things that were done in that terrible place, and then, again, of
mean and cowardly things, done by men, whom at home were brave men and
gentlemen. The only wonder is that every spark of manhood was not
utterly crushed out of those so unfortunate as to be confined within its
walls. Modern warfare presents no parallel in the treatment of
prisoners, as devised and perpetrated by the chivalric gentlemen who
managed the affairs of the so-called “Confederacy.”

But enough has been told to convey some idea of our condition while
prisoners—the many hopes deferred! the long, weary waiting, that made
the heart sick nigh unto death.

It is needless to follow our officers and men to other prisons, where
many of them were sent, when our forces got in close proximity to
Richmond. It would be the same old story, in some cases, perhaps, a
little more revolting, but in the main, one Rebel prison was a sample of
all the rest.

One thing more that should be mentioned in connection with our life in
Libby: On the 6th of July, 1863, all the Federal captains, then in
Prison, were ordered to fall in—there were seventy-two in number. They
were then taken down stairs, into a large, vacant room in the same
building and formed in a hollow square, when Capt. Turner read an order
from Gen. Winder, directing him to select, at once by lot, from among
the Federal captains in his custody, _two for immediate execution_! Each
captains name was then called, and, when answered, a slip of paper,
containing his name and regiment, was placed in a box. We were then
given permission to select one of our chaplains, if we desired, to draw
out two names. We selected Father Gray, who, after offering up a prayer,
with a trembling hand and tears standing in his eyes, drew out two slips
and handed them to Captain Turner. That moment was one of anxious
suspense to those seventy-two men who were awaiting the result. Capt. H.
W. Sawyer, 1st N. J. Cavalry, and Capt. Flinn, 51st Indiana, were the
unfortunate men. We all thought, at that time, that they would surely be
executed. They were confined in the dungeon a few days, and, our
Government taking prompt action in the matter, by holding Gen. Lee and
Capt. Winder as hostages for our men, the rebels soon relaxed their
rigor, and permitted them to come back with the other prisoners.

                           MUSTER-OUT ROLLS.


In making up these rolls great care has been exercised in endeavoring to
have each name spelled correctly; that such a result has been attained
is not to be expected. Proper names are arbitrary at best, and when the
copy from which they are taken, passes through two or three hands,
errors are very likely to occur. The following are copies of the
original Muster Out Rolls of each company:

                              CHAPTER XII.
                             MISCELLANEOUS.


On the night of December 9th, 1864, when the regiment was being
transported by rail from Opequan Bridge, in the Valley, to Washington,
on our way to join the Army of the Potomac, in front of Richmond,
Private Silas Simpson, of Company C, being on a flat-car crowded with
men, laid down near the bumper, and having, it is presumed, dropped
asleep and fallen between the cars, met with an instant death, no less
than three trains passing over his body before it was discovered that he
was missing.

During the early part of our term of service, the orders were very
strict in reference to individual foraging, and whenever complaints were
made at headquarters by some Secesh citizen, that some of the boys had
been slaughtering a beef of his, or perhaps a poor innocent porker had
gone the way of all the world, or, perchance, a box of honey, or a loaf
of bread, or a nice ham, was not to be found, then forthwith a guard
must be stationed around his house and the mens’ quarters searched for
the missing articles. The men generally received due and timely notice,
and the articles were buried in some tent and a poor sick boy, that
could not be moved, would be lying over it. The officers engaged in the
search, would perhaps look in the tent and says, “Boys, is any of that
meat or honey here?” They were never known to receive an affirmative
answer. Occasionally they would be caught in the act, as the following
incident will testify: The regiment had just gone into camp on the bank
of the Shenandoah, near Halltown, one hot day in August, 1864. The men
were nearly all bathing in the river, when they spied a field of corn on
the opposite bank and immediately went for it. Two boys of Company A,
each unadorned with any particular amount of clothing, and, having their
arms filled with roasting ears, were caught by a cavalry guard set there
to watch the corn; and without their clothing, which was on the other
side, were marched to division headquarters; from which place they were
sent, through the _regular channels_, to regimental headquarters, with
an order to have them “tied up by the thumbs.” From there Col. Wilson
sent them to company headquarters, with instructions to carry out the
order _after night_—the _particular_ night not being specified. Why
Capt. C. had plenty of corn for dinner is plain.

After any of these depredations, should any of the officers discover
next morning in their quarters, a nice steak, plate of honey or roll of
butter, it was not deemed necessary to institute a search to see where
it came from.

When we passed near Sewell Mountain, returning from the Lynchburg Raid,
June 29th, 1864, one of the men caught a young fawn and made a present
of it to the Colonel. A “hard tack” box was rigged up, the fawn put into
it and conveyed on the back of a mule to Camp Piatt; from there it was
taken with the regiment to Martinsburg, where it became a great favorite
with the men, and was finally sent from there to Ohio.

At Winchester there were several Union families, one of whom will always
be remembered with hearts full of gratitude for their kindness to many
of our regiment. The members of that family who resided there during the
war, consisted of an old Quaker gentleman, Mr. Sidwell, his wife, one
son—a young man—and his two daughters, Anna and Martha. When we were
captured there, on the 15th of June, 1863, and confined in the Court
House, we were without anything to eat for thirty-six hours. Sending a
note through one of our surgeons to Mr. Sidwell, he, in company with his
wife, soon made his appearances with a large basket of provisions, which
was certainly a rich treat to us. The next morning the two daughters
came with more supplies, and towels and soap, which afterwards proved of
great use to us in Libby. During the whole war, from its commencement to
the close, Winchester was hardly free from the conflict of battle for
any length of time, changing hands no less than _seventy-three_ times,
three times in one day. This family remained there the whole time,
unable to get away, the two daughters making it a constant practice
every day to visit the hospitals, and endeavor to ameliorate the
condition of our sick and wounded. There are several in the 123d who
will not soon forget them and their acts of kindness.

The following correspondence will explain itself:

                                       CAMP OF THE 123D O. V. I.     }
                             NEW MARKET HEIGHTS, VA., March 11, 1865 }

  _Sir_:—At the request of the commanding officer of the regiment, I
  have the pleasure of presenting through you to the State of Ohio,
  the remnants of the colors carried by the 123d Regiment of Ohio
  Volunteer Infantry during last summer’s campaign in the Shenandoah
  Valley, Virginia. They were borne through the following engagements
  in Virginia: Newmarket, May 15th, 1864; Piedmont, June 5th;
  Lynchburg, June 18th; Snicker’s Ferry, July 18th; Winchester, July
  24th; Martinsburg, July 25th; Berryville, September 3d; Winchester,
  September 19th; Fisher’s Hill, September 22d; Cedar Creek, October
  19th, 1864. Hoping that you will give them a place in the Arm and
  Trophy Department of the State, I am with great respect

  Your most obedient servant

          HON. JOHN BROUGH,      J. W. CHAMBERLIN,
              Governor of Ohio.      Capt. A Co. 123d O. V. I.

To which Gov. Brough replied as follows:

                             THE STATE OF OHIO EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, }
                                       COLUMBUS, March 24th, 1865.   }

  _Maj. J. W. Chamberlin; 123d O. V. I._

  SIR—Your favor of the 15th instant has been handed me, accompanied
  by “what remains of the colors of the 123d Regiment.” The custody of
  these tattered flags is thankfully accepted on the part of the
  State, and they will be appropriately placed among other and similar
  mementoes of the patriotism and courage of our soldiers in this
  great struggle to sustain the Government and unity of the country.

  The 123d Regiment presents a record highly honorable to its officers
  and men, and ennobling to the State. These records have given to our
  State the high rank she now occupies in the annals of the war, and
  they constitute one of the brightest pages in the history of this
  wicked Rebellion. Thanking you for the presentation made by the
  regiment,

                                          I am very truly yours.

                                                          JOHN BROUGH.

The first six months we were in the service we did a great amount of
picket duty, and for men who were then “spoiling for a fight,” it was
not generally a very pleasant labor. Still, occasionally an incident
would occur that would vary the monotony a little. One, that a few men
will not soon forget, occurred while we were at Petersburg. A large
detail from the regiment was on picket, and one of the captains—who had
never officiated as “Officer of the Day”—was acting in that capacity on
this occasion. When the hour at night came for “grand rounds” he started
out on the Franklin Pike. When nearing the post he was ordered to halt,
and to “dismount and advance one with the countersign.” He obeyed, and
with his sword drawn and at a carry, advanced to the sentinel, whose
authority he recognized by giving the salute, with drawn sword, due to a
superior officer. Soon after, Company C was picketing on the Moorefield
road, when Gen. Milroy was returning in the night with an escort from
Moorefield, but without the countersign. He was halted, compelled to
dismount, and, notwithstanding his assertions that “he was Gen. Milroy,”
was conducted to the “officer of the guard,” who recognized him
officially before he was permitted to pass.

On the 19th of October, 1864, when Sheridan, gained his famous victory
at Cedar Creek, while the infantry were lying down in two lines, waiting
for the advance, which was soon made, and while the enemy were throwing
solid shot just over us, an enterprising newsboy rode up with the
Baltimore _American_ for sale. He rode along slowly disposing of his
papers, until a solid shot struck very near his horse, when he turned
his head to the rear and rode off with the remark that “it was getting
too d—d hot for him there.”

Just after we had got fairly started on our Lynchburg raid, and when one
day the men had got very tired of carrying their one hundred rounds of
ammunition each and were grumbling much thereat, a cavalry officer rode
by, and inquiring of one of our men, “What troops are these?” received
the reply, “Troops? Hell, this is Gen. Hunter’s ammunition train!”

When the Regiment was lying at New Creek, November, 1862, Capt. Horace
Kellogg, with his company (B), was ordered by Gen. Milroy to proceed at
once to St. George, Tucker county, Virginia, and assess and collect
enough money from disloyal citizens to reimburse the loyal citizens of
that place, who had been robbed by guerrillas. Gen. Milroy’s order was
as follows “If they do not pay the amount you assess them, at the
designated time, you will proceed to burn their houses, seize their
property and shoot the men.” As soon as the company arrived at St.
George, Capt. Kellogg found out who were the disloyal subjects, and
proceeded to issue circulars to them, in accordance with Milroy’s
orders. It is needless to say that the money was forthcoming. Five
thousand dollars were collected and disbursed to the Union men who had
been despoiled of their property.


                               COMPANY D.

Inasmuch as Company D was away from the regiment on detached duty for a
time, it may be interesting to give an outline of their doings while
thus employed.

Sometime during the month of May, 1863, Company D was ordered to report
to Gen. Milroy for duty. Capt. Shawhan was appointed Provost Marshal,
and his company formed a part of the guard. Capt. Shawhan went to work
at once in the performance of the duties of his office, and made a very
efficient officer. He soon had the city thoroughly cleaned, his men
burning two kilns of lime and scattering it thoroughly about, thereby
contributing greatly in arresting the contagious diseases, that were
rapidly turning the entire city into a general hospital.

Some indiscrete young ladies insisted upon coming upon the streets
wearing gloves with “Secesh” emblems upon them, until three or four were
arrested and put in the guard house. They soon sued for peace, and ever
after there was no trouble in curbing the turbulent dispositions of the
most violent Secessionists.

During the fight at Winchester, June 15th, 1865, the company was busy
guarding prisoners and getting out ammunition for the artillery in the
forts. When the retreat commenced they had orders to follow with their
prisoners in the rear of the command. They fell in with the first
regiment they came to, the 116th O. V. I., and when they came to where
the battle was going on, that regiment was ordered to march right on to
the Potomac river. They arrived at Orleans Station on the night of the
16th, where they drew rations. On the 18th they started for Cumberland,
and when within ten miles of that place they received orders to march
into Pennsylvania, arriving at “Bloody Run,” where Milroy’s command was
reorganized. They remained there until July 4th, when, with Couch’s
Division of the 6th Corps, they followed after Lee’s retreating army,
until reaching Harper’s Ferry, when Company D was ordered to
Martinsburg, arriving there August 4th.

The regiment was collected together here, with Maj. Kellogg in command
of the post, though still suffering much from his wound.

Again, after serving with the regiment through the campaign in the
Valley, about the middle of March, 1865, they were selected to form a
part of the corps of sharpshooters for our division. The boys did not
much relish the idea of leaving the regiment again, but of course they
had no option in the matter, and at once commenced learning the use of
their Spencer rifles. They did excellent service at Hatcher’s run,
losing several in killed and wounded. Again, at Fort Gregg they were
deployed in front of our brigade in making that assault, and by their
rapid and well directed firing, assisted materially in the capture of
the fort, and were complimented by Col. Potter, our Brigade Commander,
for their good conduct. Remaining with the division until after Lee
surrendered, they then made the trip to Lynchburg. They were then sent
home and mustered out with the regiment.




                             CHAPTER XIII.
                         CASUALTIES IN DETAIL.


In making up this record—a part of the sacrifice we paid to suppress the
Slave-holders’ Rebellion—the Muster-out rolls have been closely
followed. It is very evident that they were by no means complete in this
particular, except, perhaps, in the case of two or three companies.
Every effort has been made to get a complete list of our killed and
wounded, and with what result the following will testify:


                               COMPANY A.

William F. Basom, First Sergeant, killed in action at Winchester June
13, 1863.

David D. Terry, First Sergeant, killed in action at Snicker’s Ferry July
18, 1864.

Franklin Robinson, killed in action at Winchester June 15, 1863.

                              CHAPTER XIV.
  THE ESCAPE OF OFFICERS FROM PRISONS AND A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THOSE WHO
                              DIED THERE.


                              CONCLUSION.

In the Spring of 1864 the most of our officers who were then in prison
where changed to various prisons throughout the South, some of them
making the entire circuit of Libby, Raleigh, Macon, Savannah, Charleston
and Columbia.

Two officers escaped by means of the “streight tunnel,” and Col. Wilson,
Lieut. Col. Hunter, Capt. Chamberlin, and two or three others were
exchanged and sent North, and, soon after, joined the regiment; while
the greater portion of the remainder made their escape from some of the
above named prisons and at different times. All of them, in fact, save
Lieut. M. H. Smith, who was released by Gen. Sherman, on his celebrated
march to the Sea, and Captains Riggs and Bender, who died there from
cruel treatment. And, in-as-much as the escapes were all very similar,
it will be necessary only to recount a few of them.

Captain Randolph escaped from Columbia, South Carolina, during the
Summer of ’64; by floating down the Santee river on a flat-boat, with
several others, and, after a voyage of nearly one month, reached our
fleet—blockading its mouth. On the trip they passed under several
railroad bridges guarded by soldiers, the sentinels being in plain
sight. Their plan was to float down the river at night, using long
“sweeps” to force the boat through the water. As soon as daylight came,
they would lay by for the day, secreting their boat, as best they could,
among willows, or brush of some description. As a matter of course, they
_foraged_ for their rations, or had colored men to do it for them. Sweet
potatoes were in abundance; and, with young chickens, or a pig from a
neighboring farmyard, a very fair meal could be gotten up.

On the 3d of November Lieutenants Colver and Boyce, observing that the
guards were very slack in watching the prisoners who were permitted to
go to a wood near by for fuel, thought that the time had come to attempt
their escape; so they, in company with another officer, resolved to try
it. Getting all ready, they walked out—as though they had given their
parole—and kept right on to the woods, and, as soon as they were under
cover, secreted themselves until after dark, when, taking the North Star
as their guide, they struck out for East Tennessee—distant about four
hundred miles. After having traveled six days, they suddenly came upon
some Rebel cavalry; and, while the other two were parlaying with them,
Lieut. Colver made off through the woods and escaped. He then had three
hundred miles to travel alone, but, by the never-failing aid of the
negro, he, after traveling thirty days—or rather nights—reached our
lines at Charleston, East Tennessee, and was soon at home in Ohio.

November 26th, ’64, Capt. Rosenbaum and Lieut. T. W. Boyce made their
escape from Columbia in the same manner that Lieut. Boyce did the time
he started out with Lieut. Colver, and their journeyings were of a
similar character. Lieut. Boyce, who had been over the ground part of
the way once before, knew about the direction to take. They made East
Tennessee their objective point. It was in the dead of winter, and the
ground was covered with sleet and snow for the most of the way, making
very bad walking, besides not contributing greatly to the comfort of
sleeping out of doors. However, after many narrow escapes and almost
superhuman exertions, they arrived in our lines in safety—though pretty
nearly worn out—on the 26th of December, having been just one month on
the trip.

Capt. William H. Bender, of Company I was wounded at Winchester, June
15th, ’63, and taken to Richmond, remaining there until May 7th, ’64.
From there he was taken to Macon, Georgia, thence to Savannah, where he
was taken down with fever. He recovered, somewhat, and was then taken to
Charleston and placed under “fire” in the city jail yard. On September
4th he was sent to Columbia, where he was taken down with “yellow
fever.” Receiving no medical aid for twenty-four hours after being taken
sick, he died on the morning of the 8th, a victim of Southern cruelty
and neglect. He was a good soldier, a gallant officer, and a gentleman
_always_.

Capt. Charles H. Riggs was born at Tiffin, Ohio, in 1835. He was,
therefore, at the time of his enlistment, twenty-seven years of age. He
was agent of the Cleveland and Toledo railroad at Sandusky, a position
which he filled well and ably, being well liked by the entire community
and highly esteemed by the men of the road. Thus, young, loved and
prosperous, he left with his command for the seat of war, alas! never to
return. Always deporting himself as a true soldier and Christian
gentleman, he possessed the esteem of his men and the confidence of his
superior officers. Cool and brave in the hour of danger, he had none of
the bravado spirit, that courts battle in the quiet camp, or anticipates
brave deeds to be accomplished. He was taken prisoner with his command
at Winchester, June 15th, 1863. Not of a sanguine temperament, he seemed
to think from the very first that he never again would behold the free
North or the faces of dear ones at home—which unhappy sentiment of
course little fitted him to bear up under the hardships, privations and
diseases incident to a prisoner of war. Early attacked with a chronic
complaint—from which he never seemed to rally—after long months of
suffering, he breathed his brave, young life away on the 15th day of
September, 1864, in the hospital at Charleston, amid the thunderings of
cannon hurling missiles of destruction upon the doomed city, where first
the flag of treason was flung insultingly to the breeze. Many a heart
was made sad in the regiment at the news of his death; it seemed as
though a brother had been taken from us. Groups of men upon the company
street could be seen moving listlessly along, talking over the sad
intelligence. What then must have been the sorrow of his family at home?
Poor, stricken ones, our hearts bled for you then as we sympathize with
you now. A dutiful son, a loving brother, a brave soldier, and a true
friend—well may be said of him:

    “Green be the turf above thee, friend of my better days,
    None knew thee but to love thee, nor named thee but to praise.”

Many more events and episodes of deepest interest to us might be
narrated, did space permit. Of the tiresome marches, the sleepless
nights, and the lonely picket posts, in the dead of winter, no pen can
fittingly the story relate. No! Only in your meetings can you even
faintly outline the unwritten history of your soldier lives. The
sufferings, the danger, and the privations so patiently born, you
yourselves can only know.

By these memories so holy, by our brave ones gone, by the defeats
sustained, and victories gloriously won, let us hope that the Union,
which it was our fortunes to help sustain and preserve, may remain
unbroken forever.


                                 FINIS.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
