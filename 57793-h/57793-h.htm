<p class='c005'>In consenting to write the history of the organization,
and the marches, skirmishes, battles and deeds of our
brave old regiment, at this late date, is, I know, accepting
an undertaking from which anyone might well shrink;
and yet to preserve on record the dear old story, the
task has been cheerfully attempted.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not expected that this book will be of interest to
the general reader; to those only who participated in, or
followed with loving eyes, its fortunes, will the dry details,
which must necessarily often enter into its composition,
be interesting, and without apology to the officers and
men, of the 123d Ohio Volunteer Infantry, this book is
offered as a true record of their soldier life.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>To the noble dead of our old battle-worn regiment, whether
sleeping in unknown graves, on southern battlefields,
or by the dark prison pens, where only the sighing pines
may chaunt their requiem, or it may be in the quiet
churchyards of our own bright northland, to their widows
and orphans who mourn in sorrow for their bright
noble ones who will never more return; to the maimed
and crippled ones, limping throughout the land, their
heroism saved, these pages are sacredly dedicated.</p>

<p class='c005'>The 123d Regiment was organized under the second
call for six hundred thousand troops, and was recruited
during the months of August and September, 1862, in
the counties of Erie, Huron, Seneca, Crawford and
Wyandotte, and was rendezvoused at Monroeville,
Huron county, Ohio; some companies arriving late in
August, while all were in camp early in September.
Gen. J. A. Jones was post commander, and assigned
companies to their quarters as they arrived, saw that
they were properly subsisted, &amp;c. All the companies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>except K, were mustered into the United States Service
by Capt. E. W. H. Read of the 8th U. S. Infantry, on
the 24th and 29th days of September; company K was
mustered in by Capt. Chas. C. Goddard of the 17th
Infantry, on the 16th of October, the day we left for
the seat of war.</p>

<p class='c005'>Company A was recruited in Wyandotte county by
Capt. J. W. Chamberlin, and was mustered into the service
at Monroeville, Ohio, September 24, as follows:</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Our life here was one continued round of excitement,
and all were glad when the order came, (October 16,) for
the regiment to move. A large number of friends were
there to say good bye, and amid the tears and the God
bless you of the multitude, we started for untried scenes
in the great war of the rebellion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not, perhaps, in the course of the whole war, did Ohio
send to the field a regiment of men whose whole souls
were in the cause so firmly, and whose faith in the perpetuation
of this glorious government of ours, was so
pure, as the gallant One Hundred and Twenty-third. With
officers, both in the field and line, who were not only
brave and competent, but gentlemen on all occasions;
with men whose efficiency and bravery, yet untested, but
afterward so sorely tried, and never found lacking, it was
no wonder that in the years that followed, the regiment
was often selected to perform duties requiring both courage
and discipline, secresy and dispatch.</p>

places on the river, some of which, and McConnelsville
in particular, no doubt remembered our visit for some
time.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 19th, we left on board of box cars, in two
trains, for Clarksburg, on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.
On the way a man belonging to Company H was
severely injured, and just after having passed through a
tunnel, the rear train ran into the one just ahead of it.
Three cars were thrown from the track, and down an
embankment, yet strange to say, none were very seriously
injured, though all were pretty severely shook up.
The engineer and conductor were strongly threatened by
the boys, who believed them rebels at heart, and that the
accident was a put-up affair. However, matters were at
length quieted, and soon we were on our way for Clarksburg,
where we arrived on the 20th, and went into
camp. Here we received Sibley tents, five to a company,
and two wall tents for the officers of each company.
We thought them anything but extra residences,
but before the war was over a new “dog tent” was
counted a palace. Nothing of interest occured here,
and on the 27th none were sorry when we received orders
to break camp and proceed to Buckhannon, distance 27
miles. This, our first day’s march, was through the
worst mud we ever saw, and over a road which only a
Western Virginian can appreciate. Afterward we laughed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>about this march, and would have considered it a little
pleasure jaunt, but at that time, to us, those eleven miles
seemed a hundred. We reached Buckhannon on the morning
of the 29th, and remained there in camp—resting—until
November 2d, when away we went toward Beverly,
thirty-one miles distant. The first night out we camped
at the Middle Fork of Tygart Valley river, eleven miles
from our start of the morning. On the bridge that
spans the creek at this point we found cut in the wood the
familiar names of friends in Company E, 8th Ohio, who
had gone this way before us.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was here the boys of Company G cared so well for
the teamster of a runaway team, with the wagon of the
medical purveyor, laden with wines and whisky, and at
the same time captured all the bottles with corks out, or
that could be pulled out. However, in the morning not
a vestige of a cork or bottle could be found about Company
G’s quarters.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next day we marched eighteen miles, reaching
Beverly. On the way we passed the Rich Mountain battle
ground, the engagement at this place, near a year
previous, having been so called up to that time, but the
big events that followed soon after our visit, caused it to
take rank as a skirmish only. It will be remembered
that it was here that the 87th Pennsylvania attempted to
force the guard, and thus roam through the village at
will; but finding that two batteries were rapidly wheeled
into position, and the balance of the brigade ready to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>fire on them, finally carried off their two comrades whom
the guard had shot down for attempting to pass, and sullenly
retired to their camp. We remained here “resting
up” until the 7th, marching that day to Huttonville,
eleven miles distant, and sure enough, it was a village of
Huts, and of a very few huts at that. We had a rather
cold rainy time of it here, and a good many of the boys
were taken sick and sent back to Beverly.</p>

<p class='c006'>While lying at Huttonville, Lieutenant Randolph, of
Company B, was sent out forty miles to call in a command
that was on the road towards Staunton. Procuring
a good horse, he started alone, armed only with a
sabre and revolver, and carried the order through the
enemy’s country and returned safely to his command.
We were all glad to see him back, for it was an undertaking
fraught with dangers at every turn—besides, if taken
prisoner, the chances of being treated as a spy stared
him in the face.</p>

<p class='c006'>We remained here until November 15th, when we returned
to Beverly, and encamped for the night on a level
plat of ground just east of the town.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not soon will Mrs. Arnold, a Union lady, although
the only sister of Stonewall Jackson, and residing at this
place, be forgotten by the men of the 123d Regiment.
Taking as many of our sick as she possibly could into her
own house, she nursed them through their sickness as
only a loving mother could—two of them she nursed
through a long attack of typhoid fever, and that, too,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>after the surgeon in charge had pronounced them hopeless,
and to her loving care and watchful tenderness do
these two boys yet live, owing her their lives.</p>

<p class='c006'>We received company wagons here, and on the 16th,
started for Webster, fifty-four miles distant, arriving there
on the 18th. On the route we passed over Laurel Hill,
where many a root was dug for the pipe, with which to
cheer our lonely hours, and passed the scene of the battle
of Phillippi, one of the most considerable fights of West
Virginia. The grand scenery along the route of this
entire march made the trip worth the taking, for that, if
nothing more, and surely none of us could see for what
other purpose our journeyings of the past two weeks
could possibly be, unless it was as the boys invariably
would answer, “military strategy, my boy,” though the
wisdom of this sort of thing we learned soon to distrust.
From Webster we took the cars for New Creek, arriving
there on the 19th. On the 22d we had our first grand review
by General Robt. Milroy, accompanied by General
Cluseret, who has since figured conspicuously in the late
French war. We remained at New Creek until December
12th, and during which time, besides being vaccinated
pretty thoroughly, were brigaded and re-brigaded a number
of times, finally forming a part of Col. Washburn’s
brigade, with which command we moved out to Burlington,
thirteen miles distant, and remained there awaiting
orders.</p>

<p class='c006'>Up to this time, we had scarcely realized that we were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>in reality men of war—true, we had made some hard
marches, and camped out in the snow and rain, after
plodding along all day through slush and mud; but as
yet we had not met the sterner realities belonging and
incidental  to a soldier’s life; it seemed more like a picnic
excursion, without any definite object or end; later
we gave more thought to the situation, and study to the
chances of war.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the morning of the 17th we again broke camp,
and on the afternoon of the 18th arrived at Petersburg,
a small hamlet forty-two miles from New Creek. We,
in a general way, now understood that a force of rebels
were near, and great caution was observed on the picket
line, and very little wandering from camp was indulged
in by the men. And to see how alert the camp
was, on the afternoon of the 19th the long roll was
sounded, our regiment getting into line in six minutes.
That night we slept upon our arms for the first time, at a
later day a very ordinary occurrence. On the 28th, the
116th O. V. I., and one section of the 1st Virginia battery
left for Moorefield, about eleven miles distant, and
took possession of the town. We remained here until
January 3d. At nine o’clock in the morning, orders
were received to break camp at once; tents were struck,
wagons loaded, and started for New Creek, and by quarter
past ten we were on the way to Moorefield. Soon after
starting, the firing of cannon was heard, satisfying us
that there was business ahead. Never did the regiment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>march better; those eleven miles were passed over in
two hours and ten minutes. Reaching the river bank,
Co. A was sent down the left bank of the river, and Cos.
B and G were ordered across to feel of the enemy, who
had surrounded the 116th on a hill near the town. Shots
from a rebel battery on the hill beyond soon sent them
back to the river bank, where they had orders to remain
and await the return of scouts, who had been sent out
to reach the camp of the 116th, if possible. All this
time a continued firing was kept up from a section of our
artillery, which must have done good execution, for the
enemy did not long reply. Before night we joined the
116th, the rebels having withdrawn their forces.</p>

<p class='c006'>The morning was very bright and pleasant, but by
night the winds swept cold and bleak down the valley,
and we passed about as disagreeable a night as at any
time during the war, for it will be remembered that our
wagon train was sent back to New Creek with all our
cooking utensils, provision and much of our heavier
clothing; and though the 116th Ohio did all they could
for our comfort, still our condition was anything but
comfortable.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 4th, a brigade came up under command of
General Mulligan, who now assumed command of all the
troops. The night again set in cold and blustering, and
as none of us had blankets, a cool prospect was in view.
Skirmishing began early for a bundle of hay or straw for
covering, and all prepared to make the best of the situation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Two smart chaps from Co. G crawled into a
wagon box, with their little bundle of hay to pass the
night, and were soon in the land of dreams, but their
comfort was of short duration, for a stray mule, wandering
that way, proceeded to help himself from their covering,
and did not desist so long as a straw remained.
The increased cold soon waked the boys up, and after
expressing their feelings in a very forcible manner, sought
other quarters in which to pass the remainder of the
night.</p>

<p class='c006'>At half past one, on the morning of January 6th, five
companies of the 123d, and five companies of the 116th,
with Mulligan’s Brigade, started out to attack a camp of
Rebels, distant nine miles, but after marching to near
the point designated, found that they had left in a great
hurry for a more southern clime; returning to camp,
we arrived there at 3 o’clock A. M., having marched
eighteen miles—a long walk before breakfast. It was
on this march that Gen. Mulligan compelled the men to
throw down captured chickens and turkeys, which otherwise
would have made many a good breakfast on our
arrival in camp it is needless to say, that this sort of fooling
was not indulged in to any extent in later years.
It was on this occasion, that the incident happened, which
Col. Wilson is so fond of relating, and which always
provokes a hearty laugh from listeners, especially those
who remember old Capt. Newman, of Company H,
who when asked how he came to set such an example
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>before his men, as to capture a turkey, with the evident
intention of taking it into camp, remarked that the
“Tam durkey coom’d a runnin out of the gate mit his
mouth vide open, and Colonel, you don’t tink I is goin
to let a tam durkey bite me? no sir!” As a matter of
course a reprimand was not administered. The next
day a part of the Regiment went out foraging for
grain; and in the afternoon, firing being heard in the
direction taken by them, reinforcements were sent out to
their assistance; but they soon met the boys coming in
all right, with their wagons loaded principally with
grain; but chickens, potatoes, onions, &amp;c., entered
largely into the cargo, and a pretty good supper was
the result.</p>

<p class='c006'>It will be remembered that one night while here, our
regiment was quartered in the Court House, whereupon
some good citizens, loyal to the Southern cause, went to
Gen. Mulligan and asked that the desecration be no
longer allowed; orders were immediately issued that we
should vacate at once, which of course we did, but in
no very amiable mood; for the ground was covered with
snow, and as yet we had not received our blankets. The
matting however that the aisles were carpeted with, was
all cut into strips and carried with us, and used for bedding
as long as we remained there.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 9th of January we received orders to march to
Romney, but delayed starting until the next day, camping
at night eighteen miles from Moorefield, passing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>dwelling house of the guerilla chief, Capt. McNiel, and
for the first time, at least many of us, saw regular
Southern Slave quarters. The next day at 3 o’clock in
the afternoon we arrived in Romney, which we found in
a very dilapidated condition.</p>

<p class='c006'>It soon became apparent that we were to remain here
all winter, and all tried to fix up in as comfortable
shape as possible, but a more cheerless spot to spend the
winter in could hardly have been selected, as the winds
had a fair sweep in three different directions, and as a
general thing improved the opportunity in one direction
or the other, much to our discomfort and disgust. Our
life here was one continual round of picket duty or foraging.
Very seldom did anything occur to break the
usual monotony. However on the 16th of February five
teams from our regiment and fourteen from the 116th
Ohio Regiment, under escort of Company F, 116th,
Capt. Brown commanding, went towards Moorefield, foraging
for hay, and on their return, when within about
six miles of Romney, were captured by the guerilla,
Capt. McNiel, with twenty-six men, owing to the bad
management of Capt. Brown, who allowed his men to
straggle all over the country, so that not more than three
or four of them were together at any one time, which
made their capture a very easy matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Capt. Brown was subsequently court-martialed, and
found guilty of basely deserting his command in the
face of the enemy. Our men were well treated by Capt.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>McNiel, who gave them money to buy their dinner, and
taking their parole, sent them back to camp. The next
morning Col. Washburn, of 116 O. V. I., commanding
Brigade, called upon the 123d for a company to go out
to the scene of the capture and bring in anything they
might find. Capt. Horace Kellogg’s Company was soon
in readiness and on the move. They found five wagons
all sound, but the others were all burned, nothing but
the irons and a heap of ashes left where each wagon
had stood. The company returned to camp without
accident, with the exception of accidentally shooting
several of the domestic feathered family, which carelessly
strayed across the road. Our regiment was now encamped
upon the ground occupied by the 55th O. V. I. while
encamped here one year previous. The boys planted
evergreens along their company streets and about company
headquarters, making our camp look very pleasant
and homelike. While lying here company officers were
ordered before a military board of examiners to test
their military tactics, drill, &amp;c. There was considerable
uneasiness manifested by some, but as it appeared afterwards,
without cause, for the board, for some unknown
reason never convened, and thus the troublesome ordeal
never was passed, though several of our officers concluded
that they had experienced about all the soldiering
they cared for and tendered their resignations which
were accepted, and some promotions were made as the
necessary result. We had very little opportunity for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>drill, as it was usually very muddy, and so the winter wore
monotonously away, relieved now and then by the receiving
of boxes from our friends at home, and, though
we did not materially need their contents, still this evidence
that we were warmly remembered by the dear
ones at home, gave us renewed zeal in the work we had
so cheerfully volunteered to do. Some of our officers’
wives visited us while here, and though many of us did
not even know them, their cheerful smiles and kind
words warmed the hearts of many a homesick boy, and
created within our breasts a firm determination to do
all that lay in our power to preserve inviolate the homes
of the noble women whom we had left behind.</p>

<p class='c006'>Never shall be forgotten with what avidity we devoured
the contents of our letters from home, and how sorrowingly
we would turn away when the unwelcome intelligence
was announced, “no letters to-day.” This anxiety
for news from home may seem a little strange, but when
it is remembered that many of the boys were away
from home for the first time and with no very certain
hope of ever again returning, it is not to be wondered at.</p>

<p class='c006'>We were all ready for the order to move when it
came, March 14th, 1863, for we were thoroughly tired
of lying here doing nothing, and all were anxious to
engage in the real business of war. On the morning of
the 15th we started towards Winchester and marched
twenty-one miles, encamping just east of Blue Gap.
While passing through the Gap a terrific thunder storm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>burst upon us, the rain falling in perfect sheets, drenching
us to the skin. It was certainly a wild and beautiful
sight, the mountains rising on either side to a considerable
heights, the lightening flashing, as it appeared, from
crag to crag, the thunder reverberating down the sides
of clifts, caused a feeling of awe to creep over every
heart; but the sun soon burst out in all its splendor, and
dispelled the gloom as with a magicians wand. It was
here we received the order that only the top rail of the
fences should be taken for fire wood; of course the
order was construed that we shouldn’t take the bottom
one, and was therefore strictly carried out. We encamped
near a meadow and the stacks of hay still standing
in the field were chiefly converted into fodder for the
horses, and bedding for the boys. Very soon the camp-kettles
were steaming and supper prepared, after which
all lay down and enjoyed a refreshing sleep, such as
those only can appreciate who have been similarly situated.
The next day we were on the march bright and
early, encamping at night at Hayfield Church, fourteen
miles from the start of the morning, on the finest ground
we had yet occupied as a camp, and near several springs
of clear, cold water. We arrived in Winchester the
next day, March 17th, and went into camp on the hill
near the old fort, where we remained for several days,
finally changing to a park near the Rebel burying
ground, a splendid camping ground, which the boys
fully appreciated.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>On the 4th of April we had Division Review, our regiment
being second best as to general condition and
drill.</p>

<p class='c006'>April 22d, we went on a scout up the valley as far as
Strasburg, our cavalry having a little tilt with the enemy,
but nothing decisive resulted. On the next day we returned
to Winchester with thirty prisoners. On the 25th
we again started up the valley, the next day arriving at
Wardonsville, distant thirty-one miles. On the way we
passed the celebrated Capon Springs, a beautiful place,
reopened since the war.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the morrow we marched to Lost River, and finding
the bridge gone, we returned to our camp of the
night previous. On the route we passed some of the
wildest and most beautiful scenery that West Virginia
can boast of. On the 27th we again started for Moorefield,
with arrangements for crossing the river, but when
nine miles out received orders to return, and went into
camp at Wardonsville for the third time. The next day
we marched to Strasburg, where the 13th Pennsylvania
cavalry was led into an ambush, losing several men in
killed and wounded. The Rebels, however, were
driven out, though no general engagement occured.
The next day we returned to Winchester, having marched
ninety-four miles, and that too without having accomplished
any particular end as we could see. When in
camp we were drilling steadily seven hours a day, gaining
in proficiency in the arts of war every day, and fitting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>ourselves to undergo the fatigue and hardships that
we were soon to be called upon to endure.</p>

<p class='c006'>We did a large amount of hard work while in the valley,
up to June 12th; long scouts up the valley were a
weekly occurrence, and heavy picket and fatigue duty was
the daily order of exercise, still, thanks to the excellent
water and fine weather, the health of the regiment was in
the main good. On the 5th of May, we started out with
a week’s rations and forty rounds, on a scout. The first
day out we marched for three hours through a drenching
rain-storm, such as only occurs in the valleys, we went to
New Market, and returned to Winchester on the 9th,
having marched one hundred and four miles. We saw
a few miserable bushwhackers, but nothing that would
indicate any rebel force.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was soon after this trip that the entire regiment
went out on road work, making four miles of McAdamized
road in three days.</p>

<p class='c006'>Soon after our arrival at Winchester, our Adjutant, W.
V. McCracken, and 1st Lieutenant Hugh L. McKee, of
company D, were detailed on Gen. Milroy’s staff, where
the former served until after the battle of Winchester,
and the latter was promoted to Captain and Assistant
Quarter-Master, and never again returned to the regiment.
On the 9th of June, Lieut. Gillam of company F died of
typhoid fever. He had been sick for a long time, and had
every attention and care, his wife being with him nearly
all the time.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>On the afternoon of June 12th the Long Roll sounded
and the regiment with the 116th Ohio Infantry, 12th
Virginia, and Battery D, and a regiment of cavalry
started out on the valley pike. When beyond Kearnstown
we met the enemy in considerable force, and drawing
them into an enfilading fire, gave them so warm a reception
that they started up the valley faster than they had
come down. We captured a good many prisoners, and
after night fall, we returned to camp—satisfied that the
next day would bring, as the boys termed it, “business,”
and, as events proved, their conjectures were well
founded.</p>

  <h2 id='III' class='c004'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>ACCOUNT OF THE ENGAGEMENT AT WINCHESTER, JUNE 13TH, 14TH AND 15TH, 1863.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>June 13th dawned clear and bright on the Valley
City, the quiet hush of morning gave little indication of
the scene of carnage so soon to be enacted. About 9
o’clock in the morning the long roll sounded to arms,
and soon the regiment was in line awaiting orders. Soon
they came and we were rapidly moved up the pike to
Kearnstown, where after having deployed a heavy line
of skirmishers, the regiment was halted and remained
until about 2 o’clock P. M., when rapidly drawing in
our skirmishers, we fell back a short distance and took
up a position west of the pike. While crossing the pike
the enemy opened a sharp fire upon us, and several men
were killed or wounded, but the regiment behaved
splendidly, taking their position as coolly as veterans,
though under fire, as you might say for the first time.
Volley after volley was now poured into the enemies
ranks, which must have done good execution, as their
fire very sensibly slackened. We again changed position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>to a slight eminence a few rods in the rear, where the
regiment remained firm, receiving and returning the
enemy’s fire as calmly as though drawn up on dress parade
until night drew her curtains about us and put an
end to the carnage. Our lines were now drawn close
around the city, our regiment remaining in line until
long after midnight, when we were relieved and allowed
a few hours for rest. In this day’s fight the regiment’s
loss was seventy-six men in killed and wounded. The
men acted grandly, receiving praise for their gallant
conduct from Gen. Milroy in person.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next morning we were ordered into the fort where
we remained until evening, when we were ordered to
make a sortie, but were driven back, the enemy having
captured one of our outer posts, and turned their guns
upon us.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our forces now all rallied upon the main fort where
the enemy charged us, but they were easily repulsed, and
they did not again make the attempt.</p>

<p class='c006'>All were now confidant that our position was no longer
tenable, the Rebels being largely superior in numbers
and rapidly concentrating more troops in our vicinity; a
council of war was held, when it was decided to make
the attempt to cut our way through to Harper’s Ferry if
possible. About 2 o’clock in the morning the movement
began; the column moved out on the Martinsburg pike.
Our regiment having the advance, all went well until we
had put about five miles between us and Winchester, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>were congratulating ourselves on getting out so nicely,
when all at once our advance guard struck the enemy,
who had marched around and got in our rear during the
night.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our regiment and the 87th Pennsylvania were rapidly
got into position, and immediately charged the Rebels,
who were drawn up in a wood just to the right of the
road, capturing their artillery, but were unable to hold
them against the murderous fire now poured into our
ranks, and sullenly retired for a short distance. Two
other regiments were now hurried into position, when we
again moved to the charge. In steady and firm line we
now advanced, and, though, grape and canister ploughed
great lanes through our poor ranks, not a man faltered
or turned back; but the gallant old regiment was leaving
its track marked with its dead and its dying. Once
more their guns were ours, again their deadly fire forced
our now sadly weakened lines slowly back, but only a
few rods, when once more a strong line was formed and
our boys stood grim and firm awaiting the next move. It
will be remembered that all this fighting was done in the
darkness, though the gray of morning began faintly to light
up the scene as the regiment retired from this charge.
The terrific picture presented in that wood we shall not
soon forget; the flashes of musketry in the darkness,
casting a sickly glare all around; the roar of artillery,
the crashing of grape shot through the brush; the cheers
of the charging troops, and cries of the dying left an impress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>that will remain vivid in our memories while time
with us remains.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not long were we held inactive; for the third time,
over the same ground, did our gallant little band make
their way, and though greatly weakened in numbers,
with unfaltering step, and shoulder to shoulder, the dangerous
distance was again traversed, but only to repeat the
sickening details of the first and second charges. On retiring
from this last assault we fell slowly back out of the
range of their guns, repulsed—sadly stricken, yet still
undaunted, for by this time we, of course, supposed that
the entire army would be on the ground and in shape for
action. That we were whipped we had not the remotest
idea, and when a white flag was hoisted—as we afterwards
learned—by the orders of Col. Ely of the 18th
Connecticut, who was left in command, all were completely
taken aback, for there was not the slightest doubt
but that we could have got away as easily as not; however
we had to submit and surrendered three hundred
and one men and twenty-one commissioned officers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Throughout these three days of bloody baptism, the
men and officers behaved in the most gallant manner. In
the storm of grape and canister Col. Wilson, Lieut.-Col.
Hunter and Maj. Horace Kellogg, rode their horses as
coolly as though it were simply a hail storm, which, undoubtedly,
contributed greatly in keeping the regiment
so firmly to the work.</p>

<p class='c006'>In making the second charge Major Kellogg was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>severely wounded, and retired soon after from the field
and succeeded in making his escape into Maryland, where
those of the regiment who made their escape were subsequently
collected together. Company D, Capt. Shawhan
commanding, being on provost duty, were in charge
of the prisoners, and of course did not participate in the
fight, which was not only fortunate for them, but for the
regiment also, as otherwise there would have been no
nucleus around which to gather. In this engagement
our loss was fifty-one men in killed and wounded, and
three officers wounded, one of whom, Capt. Bender of
company I, afterwards died in prison. We afterwards
learned that, while our regiment together with four
others, was making this desperate fight, the rest
of our forces flanked the enemy and pushed right on to
Harper’s Ferry, leaving us to our fate; perhaps it was
for the best, but, from our stand-point, we failed to see the
beauty of the strategy.</p>

<p class='c006'>We were taken back to Winchester about noon, preparatory
to being sent in to Dixie, which was soon
after done.</p>

  <h2 id='IV' class='c004'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>HISTORY OF REGIMENT FROM JUNE 15TH, 1863, TO MAY 18TH, 1864, INCLUDING THE ENGAGEMENT AT NEW MARKET.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>So large a portion of the regiment being now captured,
we propose to follow their fortunes into Rebeldom
as a regiment. Company D acting as provost
guard to Gen. Milroy, went out with the balance of the
army, doing guard duty at various points until the regiment
was again organized, as will subsequently appear.
After the surrender of the forces by Col. Ely, as narrated,
the men of the 123d were marched into the fort
at Winchester, and there confined until such time as the
Rebels could make it convenient to take them to their
future prison.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, indeed, did the situation seem anything but
cheerful; the Rebel army had passed north, and as we
supposed, were marching about unopposed, over the
States of Maryland and Pennsylvania. They had made
their boasts that some of the great cities of the North
should taste the horrors of war, and we did not know but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>at that moment Lee’s hordes might be running riot
through the streets of Philadelphia. The cause of the
Union, the cause for which we had suffered, seemed at a
low ebb. It will be remembered that we were now
passing through a phase of life entirely different from
anything heretofore experienced. Very few of us had
ever been in duress for a single instant; and thus to be
deprived of our liberties, to become the creatures of
another’s will, it is not surprising that our faith for a time
weakened, and the darkness of despair seemed well nigh
upon us. We, however, were treated with some degree
of humanity by the Rebels, and received many proofs
that there were some good and true Union people living
in Winchester, for which they, one year later, received
satisfactory and substantial tokens of our esteem.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the afternoon of the 16th, the men were started on
their long journey to Richmond, arriving at Staunton on
the 22d, distant ninety miles. Here we took the cars
for Richmond, arriving there on the 23d. It seemed as
though the entire Rebel capitol had turned out to see
the Yankees, and would hoot and hiss at us as we passed
along. The officers took up their quarters at Hotel-de-Libby;
the men were furnished accommodations on
“Belle-Isle,” which by the way was nothing more nor
less than a large sand bank, with a few trees upon it, situated
near the south bank of the James River. We were
closely guarded, not even allowed the privilege of buying
one of their own papers, though we managed to get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>one now and then from the guards. It is needless to
recount our sufferings here, as no pen can do adequate
justice to the subject. I will only say that the meat and
soup were full of maggots, and the bread so stale and
sour as to be almost unpalatable, these constituting our
eatables, while the water we drank was even worse.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 6th of July the majority of the men were paroled, and
were taken to City Point, by rail, <i>via</i> Petersburg,
and delivered to the United States authorities. Never
were the Stars and Stripes more enthusiastically cheered,
than when we first saw them streaming from the Flag of
the Truce boat; once on board we had plenty to eat, and
soon all were in high spirits. On arriving at Annapolis—where
those left in prison joined us one week later—we
were furnished new clothing throughout, our old ones
being full of “gray-backs,” and were supplied with comfortable
quarters. Very soon the boys began to scatter
to their homes, where most of them were allowed to remain
until they were exchanged, after which time they
were ordered to report at Camp Chase. About the 1st
of September, most of them were on hand, and soon after
were sent to Martinsburg, Virginia, where the detachment
of the regiment which had escaped from Winchester
were located under command of Maj. Horace
Kellogg, who had sufficiently recovered from his wound
to again take the field.</p>

<p class='c006'>From this time the history of our organization, as a
regiment again commences. At this place we were newly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>armed and equipped, and being deficient in officers,
twenty-one being still in prison, were engaged mainly in
provost and picket duty until March 1st 1864. During
the month of November, Adjutant McCracken, with one
non-commissioned officer from each company was sent
to Ohio to recruit, and fill up our depleted ranks. Very
good success was met with, adding one hundred and
twenty-eight men to our effective force; some promotions
were also made; sergeants S. A. Johnson, Elmer E.
Husted, Charles M. Keyes and Martin W. Willoughby
were promoted to 2d lieutenants. The winter was quietly
spent in camp, which was located one-half mile west
of town; when the weather permitted, drilling by company
and squad occurred daily, so that when spring
opened, the regiment was in good condition and ready
for any duty which might turn up. On March 1st, 1864,
the companies were distributed as guards along the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad, between Harpers Ferry and
Monocacy Junction, with headquarters at Martinsburg.</p>

<p class='c006'>About the 26th of March the regiment was collected
together at Martinsburg where Gen. Siegel was concentrating
troops preparatory to a movement up the valley;
and from the orders issued to our little army, we knew
that our season of inaction was drawing to a close. On
the 29th we broke camp at Martinsburg and marched out
to Bunker Hill, remaining there two or three days, when
we proceeded to Winchester and encamped about two
miles beyond the city; a portion of the regiment was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>sent into the city, under command of Capt. Snyder to act
as provost guard, with orders to search the town, which
was done, and a large collection of old guns, swords and
accoutrements were collected together and destroyed.
About the 1st of May our forces moved up the valley as
far as Cedar Creek, where they remained until the 10th
making the final preparations for our grand raid on
Lynchburg. Baggage was cut down to the minimum;
each soldier was provided with an extra pair of shoes,
and loaded down with rations and ammunition, we broke
camp, and moved leisurely on through Strasburg, Woodstock,
and Mt. Jackson, to New Market, where, on the
night of the 14th we struck the enemy in some force, our
brigade having the advance, we had a lively little skirmish,
but of short duration, the Rebels soon giving way.
We laid on our arms during the night, but no attack was
made.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next morning our brigade was maneuvered around
in various directions, the artillery placed in position, and
things began to look as though a battle was imminent, but
for some unknown reason, the remainder of our little
army was not brought up; about noon the enemy opened
upon us with artillery, to which our batteries rapidly
replied, and soon their lines could be seen coming across
the fields, two deep, one directly behind the other, with
a heavy line of skirmishers in advance, and nothing but
our brigade to receive them. We were in a good position,
and with the artillery on either flank, awaited their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>approach. Soon our cannons opened on their rapidly
advancing lines, dealing death and destruction, but not
checking them for an instant; on they came, sweeping
like an avalanche upon our little band. We held our fire
until they were almost within pistol shot, when we
poured in our volleys, with terrific effect; rapidly were
our well directed volleys given, doubling their first line
back upon their second, that still came unfalteringly on,
lapping by our little line, both on the right flank and the
left, rapidly firing as they advanced until our little band
could no longer withstand their overwhelming numbers,
and slowly we began to retire—taking our cannon back
through a cedar thicket, our pathway marked with the
blood of our braves. As they appeared over the eminence
we had lately occupied, they poured in upon us
such a storm of shot and shell, so thick that the very air
seemed alive with bullets. On passing through here on
our way up the valley a month later, we examined this
spot, and found scarce a tree or bush unmarked, showing
that the fire at this point must have been severe indeed.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the crest of the hill beyond another stand was
made, which checked their advance for a short time, but
soon we were again compelled to fall back, this time
pretty badly shattered. Major Kellogg, commanding
the regiment, had his horse shot from under him and
received quite a severe wound himself. He, however,
was supplied with another horse by the officer commanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>a battery near at hand, and again rallying his command,
which fell back in good order. By this time we had
reached our reserves on Rood’s Hill, about three miles
from where the attack commenced, which checked the
enemies advance until night put an end to the conflict.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this engagement the regiments loss was sixty-three
in killed and wounded, and twenty-six missing. The
missing being all taken prisoners, many of whom were
afterwards slowly tortured to death in prison. The army
was now drawn back to Ceder Creek, where we arrived
on the 17th. Gen. Siegel had been relieved and Gen.
Hunter placed in command.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>
  <h2 id='V' class='c004'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>LYNCHBURG  RAID.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>On the 22d of May, 1864, just previous to starting on
this raid, the General commanding issued the following
order:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in7'>Headquarters Department West Virginia }</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>In the Field, near Cedar Creek</span>, May 22, 1864.}</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<div class='lg-container-l c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>GENERAL ORDERS. }</div>
      <div class='line in4'>No. 29.     }</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It is of the utmost importance that this army be placed in a situation
for immediate efficiency. We are contending against an
enemy who is in earnest, and if we expect success, we too must be
in earnest. We must be willing to make sacrifices, willing to suffer
for a short time, that a glorious result may crown our efforts. The
country is expecting every man to do his duty; and, this done, an
ever kind Providence will certainly grant us a complete success.</p>

<p class='c010'>I. Every tent will be immediately turned in for transportation
to Martinsburg; and all baggage not expressly allowed by this
order, will be at once sent to the rear. There will be but one
wagon allowed to each regiment, and this will only be used to
transport spare ammunition, camp kettles, tools and mess-pans. Every
wagon will have eight picked horses or mules, two drivers and two
saddles. One wagon and one ambulance will be allowed to Department
Headquarters, and the same to Division and Brigade
Headquarters. The other ambulances will be under the immediate
orders of the Medical Director.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>II.  For the expedition on hand, the clothes each soldier has on
his back, with one pair of extra shoes and socks, are amply sufficient.
Everything else in the shape of clothing, will be packed
to-day and sent to the rear. Each knapsack will contain one
hundred rounds of ammunition, carefully packed, four pounds of
hard bread, to last eight days, ten rations of coffee, sugar and salt,
one pair of shoes and socks, and nothing else.</p>

<p class='c010'>III.  Brigade and all other commanders will be held strictly
responsible that their commands are amply supplied from the
country. Cattle, sheep and hogs, and if necessary, horses and
mules must be taken and slaughtered. These supplies will be
seized under the direction of officers duly authorized, and upon a
system which will hereafter be regulated. No straggling or pillaging
will be allowed. Brigade and other commanders will be held
responsible that there is no waste, and that there is a proper and
orderly division amongst their men of the supplies taken for our
use.</p>

<p class='c010'>IV.  Commanders will attend personally to the prompt execution
of this order, so that we may move to-morrow morning. They
will see that in passing through a country in this way, depending
upon it for forage and supplies, great additional vigilance is required
on the part of every officer in the command of men, for the
strict enforcement of discipline.</p>

<p class='c010'>V.  The Commanding General expects from every officer and
soldier of the army in the field, an earnest and unhesitating support;
and relies, with confidence, upon an ever kind Providence for
a glorious result. The Lieutenant General, commanding the armies
of the United States, who is now victoriously pressing back the
enemy upon their last stronghold, expects much from the Army of
the Shenandoah; and he must not be disappointed.</p>

<p class='c010'>VI.  In conclusion, the Major General commanding, while
holding every officer to the strictest responsibility of his position,
and prepared to enforce discipline with severity when necessary,
will never cease to urge the prompt promotion of all officers;, non-commissioned
officers and enlisted men who earn recognition by
their gallantry and good conduct.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>At this time the 123d Ohio, with 116th and 28th Ohio,
18th Connecticut, 2d Indiana (P. H. B.) and 160th Ohio
(N. G.), constituted the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division;
Col. Moore of the 28th Ohio Regiment commanding, and
Brig. Gen. Sullivan Division commander. The regiment
was then lying in camp at Cedar Creek, Maj. Kellogg
being in command. During the night of the 25th, Col.
Wilson and Capt. Chamberlin rejoined the regiment,
just having been exchanged as prisoners of war. In
compliance with the order just given, each man was
required to pack in his knapsack one hundred rounds of
ammunition, which in addition to the extra clothing allowed,
and four days rations of hard bread, caused
some grumbling among the men at being converted into
a pack train as they styled it.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the morning of the 2d, Col. Wilson having assumed
command of the regiment, Gen. Hunter, with his
whole command, started up the valley on the proposed
trip to Lynchburg. The regiment reported four hundred
men for duty. We marched fourteen miles, and went
into camp. Next morning we were routed out at 4 o’clock
to see how promptly we could get into “line of
battle,” which was done in just five minutes. We remained
here in camp until Sunday morning the 29th, drilling
some. One day the whole regiment was ordered out
as a foraging party; reported at Division Headquarters
for duty, when the order was countermanded and we
were sent back to our quarters. We now had ten commissioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>company officers with the regiment. Dr.
Ferris was acting as Brigade Surgeon, and the Chaplain as
Postmaster. Sunday we marched to Rood’s Hill, and
went into camp. The next day details from each regiment
were busy scouring the country and bringing in all
the provisions they could discover. A few men from the
regiment, under Capt. Dwight Kellogg, were placed in
charge of a mill near by, and began making flour as fast as
possible, running night and day. The 10th Ohio (N. G.),
complaining very much of being taken to the front,
were sent back on the 30th. On June 1st, flour was issued
to the men for the first time since we entered the service.
It took some time for them to become accustomed to
the use of it, but our hard tack was exhausted and it
was “slap-jacks” or nothing. At 5 o’clock on the
morning of the 2d, we again started, passing through
New Market. We saw a few Rebels once during the day,
when we were halted and formed in line of battle; but
it amounted to nothing, and we soon passed on;
about 3 o’clock P. M., we reached Harrisburg, a distance
of twenty-two miles. Our advance had a small
skirmish with the “Jonnies,” but nothing serious occured.
The main force encamped about a mile from
town, the 123d going into camp just within the suburbs.
In a few moments, Capt. Chamberlin, with a hundred
and fifty men, was sent into town with directions to
picket around the town, and with the remainder of the
men to search thoroughly for arms, provisions and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>every thing that could be used by the army. Soon
after, fifty more men were sent from the regiment and
quartered in the Court House. Lieutenants Leonard and
Williams were in charge of the pickets; and Lieutenants
Keyes, Hustead and Willoughby of the Provost guards,
under direction of Lieut. Col. Starr, Provost Marshal
General, and at once destroyed the press, type, etcs.,
belonging to the office of the <cite>Rockingham Register</cite> then
remained under arms all night. Next day the men were
divided into small parties, and searched the town completely;
the result of which was an accumulation in
the Court House yard of seventy-five barrels of flour, a
lot of meat, sugar, corn, wheat, tobacco, (the most
plentiful article found), a bale of sheeting and some arms
and accoutrements. Capt. Chamberlin, at his quarters,
was bothered all day by men, women and children, who
were endeavoring to recover certain articles thus appropriated.
Some pleading, some demanding and others
threatning what their friends would do to “you’ns,” if
they were at home. Three or four families were excepted
from the search on the account of their Unionism
and kindness to wounded Federal soldiers, who fell into
their hands at the battle of New Market, and who were
able to designate with unerring certainty those who
should be thus excepted. During the day the remainder
of the 123d moved into town and took up their quarters
near the Court House. Next morning, Saturday, June
24th, we started for Staunton directly, distant only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>twenty-four miles; but after marching two or three
miles, we left the pike to the right, and attempted to
flank into Crawford, where the pike crosses the Shenandoah;
we reached the river about 1 o’clock P. M.,
and remained there some three hours, while the Pontoon
Corps was bridging the river. During this time our
troops destroyed a large woolen factory just across the
river, in a small town called Port Republic; then marching
through the town just at dark, we went into camp in
the <i>brush</i>, the teams did not get up till midnight.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the morning of the 5th, we started at 5 o’clock,
our regiment being at once deployed as skirmishers on
the left of the Brigade. Our cavalry videttes soon met
the enemy and had quite a skirmish; they falling back
to near a little town called Piedmont, about nine miles
from our camp of the night previous. The 123d was
soon placed along the wagon train as guard. About 10
o’clock A. M.; our force attacked the enemy in their position,
which was a strong one; a heavy fight was kept
up until 3 o’clock P. M., when a furious charge was made
by both Brigades of infantry, completely driving them
out of their works, routing them thoroughly, and capturing
one thousand two hundred prisoners, among
whom was Gen. Vaughn. Rebel General Jones was
killed. The loss on both sides was very great, both
Union and Rebel dead being found side by side all
over the field. The 123d was ordered up just at the close
of the action, but not in time to participate. Early next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>morning company A was sent out to the battlefield to
gather up and destroy the arms lying there, some one
thousand two hundred stands. While engaged in the
performance of this duty, under the direction of the
Provost Marshal General, by piling them up in large
piles, first a tier of rails, then one of muskets, muzzles all
pointing one way, for many of them were loaded, and although
the men had been repeatedly cautioned by Capt.
Chamberlin and Lieut. Husted, not to go in front of the
piles, Sergeant Baroff incautiously did so; at this moment
one of the pieces was discharged by a rail thrown
on the pile, the ball passing nearly through his right leg,
half way between the knee and hip, shattering the bone
very badly and rendering amputation imperatively necessary.
He was at once taken back to the Field Hospital,
since which time nothing was ever heard from him. The
company immediately joined the regiment already on
their march toward Staunton, arriving there about 4
P. M., a distance of twelve miles, being the first Union
Infantry that had ever been there. We met with no resistance
whatever, the Rebels having fled in another direction.
We found several hundred of their sick and wounded
here. The regiment went into camp one mile west of
town. Dr. Brisbine, who had been promoted to Assistant
Surgeon, joined the regiment while on the march.
Before leaving here our troops destroyed the railroad depot,
bridges, track and telegraph, in and near town.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>We then started for Buffalo Gap, distant ten miles,
marching in three columns, cavalry and artillery in the
road, and a brigade of infantry on each side. We
marched some five miles through woods and underbrush,
then halted and in a short time returned, and went into
the same camp we had occupied the night previous. An
ambulance train was sent back to the battlefield
after the wounded, returning late at night. Gen. Averill,
with whom we were expecting to make a junction at this
point, arrived with his command, making us, now, quite
a formidable little army.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the afternoon of June 7th, three hundred and fifty
men and eight officers, under command of Capt. Chamberlin,
were sent out to relieve the 28th Ohio, then doing
picket duty. Part of the men were stationed on a
hill where, just about a year before, they were permitted
to rest for a few hours, when on their way to Richmond
as prisoners of war. The contrast between their situation
then and now was vividly appreciated by the boys.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 9th the regiment returned to camp, and shoes
were issued to those of the men who needed them. The
prisoners captured at Port Republic, were sent to the
rear in charge of the 28th Ohio—whose term of service
having expired—was going home. Here Chaplain Ferris
resigned, his resignation being accepted at once;
and he left for home with this return train. Our command
left next morning, moving on three different
roads, Averill on one, Crooks on another, and Hunter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>on the Lexington road. Our regiment marched in the
rear as wagon guard. A very long and dusty march,
passed through Greenville—where a large mill was destroyed—to
Midway, a distance of eighteen miles, where
we went into camp very tired. In a few moments company
A was sent out as a support to a battery of artillery
near the picket line, Saturday the 11th. We started at
5 A. M., drew rations of flour just as we left, but no
time was allowed to prepare any of it; on this account,
and the great heat and dust, the men became very much
fatigued before night, and very many were compelled to
fall back during the day. We marched seventeen miles
to within sight of Lexington. We found Gen.
Crooks here in advance and skirmishing with a small
force of the enemy, who had burned the bridge over the
river, and then scattered some sharpshooters along the
shore, to harass our men, while constructing their pontoon
bridge; but our troops soon drove them back with
but small loss on our part. While this was being done,
our division of infantry lay in position about two miles
from town from 2 to 6 P. M. We then went into camp
about half a mile from the river.</p>

<p class='c006'>Next day we crossed the river and went into camp in
the edge of town. Military Institute, which is located
here, was destroyed. On the 13th we still remained
in camp. Some canal-boats were captured with
artillery and ammunition which were destroyed. Next
morning we were early on the move again, and although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>it was extremely warm and dusty, we succeeded in making
a distance of twenty-four miles to Buckannon. We passed
within two miles of the natural bridge, but there was no
time for hunting curiosities. Our march was along an
old plank-road. The Rebels had endeavored to destroy
many small bridges, and thus obstruct our progress;
but we were so close on them, they succeeded in doing
but little damage, until we reached Buckannon, where we
found the bridge over the James River in ruins, and we
were compelled to cross in canal barges. Two companies
of the regiment were guarding prisoners, under
command of Lieutenants Leonard and Keyes. Our
“hard-tack” was all gone, and flour getting scarce, but
fresh beef and mutton still plenty. The next day we
were on the road about 9 A. M., and went to the edge of
town, where we laid until after dinner, when we again
started in the direction of Lynchburg. We crossed Otter
Peak, a very high mountain, with a very narrow,
rough road over it. In many places our way was obstructed
by trees that had been felled across; undoubtedly
done by Bushwhackers, for in one place there lay
the dead body of one, who had been caught in the act
and slain by our advance. We went into camp, for the
night, at 9 o’clock, about halfway down the mountain.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following morning we started at 5 o’clock, marched
through Liberty to a point five miles beyond where we
went into camp. While halting in the town, several
men of the “5th Heavies” were pillaging a large dwelling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>house—in which the family were still residing—of
pictures, books, and other articles that could be of no
use to them. A squad of men from company A, were
sent into the house with orders to clean them out at the
point of the bayonet, which was promptly done. The
123d was all on picket again at night.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 17th we started as usual very early. After
marching two miles, to the creek, we found the bridge
burned, and had to wait some three hours for the Pontoon
corps to repair damages. We then moved on
through New London. Generals Crooks’ and Averill’s
commands met the enemy, and had quite an engagement
some three miles from Lynchburg. They drove the
Rebels from two different positions, capturing some artillery
and prisoners. We arrived at the front about
dark, and relieved the advanced line. Company F was
immediately sent out on the skirmish line. This morning
a part of the wagon train was detached and sent to
the rear. Two “One-Hundred-Day” regiments accompanied
them as escort. We had marched twenty-four
miles, and, it being very hot, many of the men gave out.
On the morning of the 18th company F was relieved by
company D, under command of Capt. Shawhan, the
former having lost three killed, Sergeant Dunn, and Privates
Kiehl and Savage, and six wounded. The Rebel
skirmish line was composed of sharpshooters, many of
whom were armed with long-range rifles, and stationed
in tree-tops, doing severe execution. All night we could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>hear the trains running into Lynchburg, bringing reinforcements
from Richmond, and the next morning skirmishing
commenced at once, and fighting, to some extent,
continued all day. Company D, while on the
skirmish line, was under a sharp fire nearly all the time,
which, however, resulted in no loss to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Company G had one man, private Stokely, wounded
by the explosion of a shell. About dusk it was decided
to fall back, and at 8 o’clock P. M., we commenced our
retrograde movement; we marched all night, reaching
Otter Creek the next morning, the 19th, after a very
tedious and severe tramp; the boys being very much
exhausted and needing rest, a great many dropping
down by the side of the road, would fall asleep on the
road, and it would be almost impossible to arouse them.
We encamped two miles beyond Liberty, where we
rested a couple of hours, and then moved on. While
here our rear had some severe skirmishing with the
enemy, who were endeavoring to harass our troops and
cut off part of our train, but were repulsed and driven
off. About 2 o’clock A. M., on the 20th, we rested a
couple of hours, then moved on till 8 o’clock A. M.,
when we halted an hour for breakfast. While here Gen.
Hunter, in person, asked for two companies of the regiment
to destroy a large pile of wood and a water tank
on the railroad near by, which was done effectually. We
went into camp at noon, having marched forty five miles
in forty hours and on very limited rations, in fact nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>but fresh beef and mutton. We had rested only a few
moments when there was some skirmishing in our rear,
and we were ordered to move forward again. We
marched on all night, this being the third night without
any sleep, through Conyer Springs and Big Lick to
within one mile of Salem, arriving there on the morning
of the 21st, where we found skirmishing again in progress;
the Rebels endeavoring to get in our front. Two
companies of our regiment were immediately sent out as
skirmishers, but met no enemy. We rested there until
10 o’clock, when we moved on through Salem about two
miles, where we found the enemy had attacked the train
and captured sixteen pieces of artillery and some men,
but being closely pressed only succeeded in disabling six
pieces, taking none away with them. We then made a
forced march of seven miles, which we did in one hour
and twenty minutes, to overtake the train. We rested
there two hours, and were highly complimented by
Col. Wells, our brigade commander, for our close and
rapid marching with no straggling. We moved on again
at 4 o’clock P. M., marching on a regular “back and
forth” road, over a mountain, and went into camp
twelve miles from Salem, having marched twenty-four
miles in twenty-four hours. Meat and coffee in small
quantities were issued to the men at this point.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the morning of the 22d we were ordered into line
and maneuvered around some, but did not get fairly
started until 1 o’clock P. M. We marched in the rear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>of the column all day, encamping at half past ten in a
very stony field at New Castle Court House; just before
arriving there we forded Craig’s creek three times. The
men were completely jaded, many dropping down where
they stood, when the regiment halted, and almost instantly
falling asleep.</p>

<p class='c006'>We were aroused at 2 o’clock for an early start, but
were delayed by the wagon train until 9 A. M. Our entire
brigade acted as train guard, one company to every
ten wagons, and a heavy escort for the artillery. This
was the hardest day’s march in our experience, not on
account of its length, but that it was over three mountains—we
were now crossing the Alleghanies—one of
them being eleven miles over, and a portion of the time
we had to march very rapidly to keep up with the train.
Horses and mules were “playing out” in great numbers,
and had to be pushed from the road, over the side of the
mountain, in order that the train might pass. The
weather continued very hot and dry, and the road very
dusty; we made a halt of two hours at half past 10 in the
evening, for coffee and mutton, nearly all being too
tired to prepare it for eating; then on again for six
miles, going into camp at half past 3 in the morning at
Sweet Springs. We remained there until 4 P. M., when
we started for “White Sulphur” Springs. The road
was very rough, and the night quite dark, making this a
very severe march; we arrived there at half past 3, the
next morning, June 24th.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>This was the place where the southern aristocracy, before
the war, came to air their wealth and gamble for
darkies.</p>

<p class='c006'>It must have been a very pretty spot then, with its living
springs of clear, cold water, and fine mountain scenery
on all sides; but to us, it was simply a place to rest
our wearied limbs for a few hours. We now had nothing
but meat to eat, and very little of that.</p>

<p class='c006'>We started again in the afternoon, passing through
Lewisburg, and going into camp four miles beyond at
mid-night. Just at sunset we waded Greenbrier River,
where it was about fifty rods wide and waist deep. We
crossed in three columns, forming a beautiful sight to
one placed where he could view it. The sun shining on
the water and on the polished gun-barrels made it dazzling
to the eyes, while every now and then some unfortunate
fellow would make a miss step and get a complete
ducking, thereby creating a laugh at his expense.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 26th, we marched all day, resting once for a
little time, when the men drew some beef. We had a
nice little shower in the afternoon, the first rain since leaving
Staunton. Next day we marched eighteen miles,
our regiment taking the advance. It rained hard after
we went into camp, and we put up our “Dog-Tents,”
the first time we had done it for ten days. We here met
a small train, from which was issued three-fourths of a
day’s rations of hard bread, bacon, sugar and coffee.
The men slaughtered a few straggling porkers they discovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>near camp, and then managed to have a real
jolly supper in the rain.</p>

<p class='c006'>We were on the road early on the morning of the
28th, and, at noon, met another train, and drew two days’
rations of hard bread.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 29th our march was over quite a hilly road,
along the New River, through mountain gorges, and
over rushing streams, crossing Gauley River at Gauley
Bridge—no bridge however only in name—where the
Gauley and New Rivers unite and form the Kanawha.
Near this spot is a view of natural scenery, almost rivalling
Niagara in some respects. Upon a ledge of rocks
overhanging the river, you can stand and look directly
down a distance of two hundred feet to the bed of the river,
then cast your eyes directly in front of you and see the
other river coming down through the mountain gorges
and emptying into the New, while all around the mountains
tower up in all their majesty and grandeur. We
went into camp about one mile beyond the bridge.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Lynchburg raid may now be called completed,
for we have again reached our supplies. This march was
very severe on our regiment, and many were now sick and
worn out. Our rations were exhausted before we were
fully started, and, a large portion of the country through
which we passed, being very sparsely settled, we found
great difficulty in procuring food, as the country had
nothing in it to eat either for man or beast. For four
days the regiment marched day and night, not halting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>over two hours at any one time. For nine days we had
nothing to eat but fresh beef and mutton, and a very little
coffee. With all this the heat was intense, the roads
very dusty, and the men became so completely exhausted,
that frequently when the command halted, they would
drop down just where they stood, and to get them started
again, it was necessary to arouse every man, and not
only arouse him, but get him on his feet, and even then
they could often be seen in the ranks, marching along,
sound asleep. Had there been anything in the country
to subsist upon, we might have taken it leisurely, but as
it was—it was simply a march for rations, and this fact
the men all understood, for it was so stated in a general
order from Army Headquarters, and read to each regiment,
hence there was little or no grumbling at the severity
of our marching.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the result of this raid—we marched five hundred
miles since leaving Martinsburg, destroying a large
amount of property, captured fifteen hundred prisoners,
over a thousand head of cattle, a large number of sheep,
besides living—if it could be called living—off the country
through which we passed. Several hundred negroes
came through with us, many of them remaining with the
various regiments as servants. On the other hand, we
lost about one thousand horses and mules that gave out,
and nearly one hundred wagons, that we were compelled
to destroy, and lost quite a number of men, who were
“played out,” and undoubtedly fell into the hands of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>enemy. The men’s shoes were giving out some partially,
and occasionally one would be seen entirely bare-foot,
trudging along with the rest, for it was sure capture to
straggle, and the men knew it. The main object of the
raid, which was doubtless to threaten Lynchburg, and
thus cause Lee to weaken his forces in front of Richmond,
by sending reinforcements to Lynchburg, was fully
obtained.</p>

<p class='c006'>The regiment was mustered for pay on the 30th, and
remained in camp until July 2d, when we started for
Camp Piatt, a distance of twenty-seven miles, there to
take boats for some place unknown. It was a very warm
day, and by 1 o’clock, we had marched fifteen miles,
barely stopping once, a few minutes for rest. The men
appeared to suffer more from this day’s march, than any
previous one. Each man had three days’ rations in his
haversack, and eating very freely, nearly every one was
afflicted with that terrible camp disease, dysentery.
Resting two hours, we then moved on four miles and
camped for the night.</p>

<p class='c006'>Next morning we were on the way again, reaching
Camp Piatt at 5 o’clock. On the morning of the 4th,
company A with a portion of the “5th Heavies” (5th
N. Y. H. Artillery) and the Pioneer corps were loaded
on the steamboat, “Mattie Roberts,” and moved down
the river slowly, the remainder of the regiment following
in other boats. At Gallipolis the regiment was changed
to the “Anglo Saxon.” Then moving up the Ohio, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>soon had to change to the “Inno,” a light draft boat,
on account of the low stage of water in the river. Opposite
Blennerhasset’s Island, we found we could get no
further and were compelled to land and march into Parkersburg,
a distance of six miles. At 10 o’clock of the
6th, the regiment was loaded on cars and started for our
old home again, the Shenandoah Valley, arriving at
Cherry Run on the 8th of July and went into camp.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Two days’ rest at this place when we were again on the
road, without having received any supplies of clothing,
although sadly needing them; many of the boys were
bare-footed, and all, with uniforms, filthy and in tatters,—as
can readily be concieved, when it is taken into consideration,
that they had been used for marching in by
day and sleeping in by night, with nothing to protect
them from the pelting storm while marching, or from
the ground while lying down, and this for over six weeks
upon a raid, which for continuous fighting, severe marching
and scarcity of rations, the history of the war presents
no parallel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Arriving at Martinsburg on the afternoon of July 13th,
we visited some of our old haunts, and found that things
had undergone changes generally, that the Rebels had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>been here, since we’d been gone, was evident, as many
of our officers found out to their displeasure. All of our
baggage, and camp and garrison equipage, was stored here,
when starting on the “raid” up the valley; the officers
leaving their valises at different private houses, containing
their best clothing, all of which had been visited, and
their contents duly confiscated. Lieutenants Johnson and
Keyes being the only ones overlooked, for which they
were duly thankful, and indulged in a little merriment at
their brother officers’ misfortune.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 13th we broke camp, taking the road towards
Harper’s Ferry, arriving there the next forenoon. On
the 15th we again started out, crossing the river on a
pontoon bridge, and marched down to Berlin, a little
dried-up town, six miles below the Ferry, on the north
bank of the Potomac, with no feature of interest, save
the wildly beautiful scenery that abounds on either hand;
the bold bluffs on the opposite bank—tree-crowned—seemingly
guarding the noble river below, while away to
the southward, the Blue Ridge, rising tier on tier, giving
the surrounding atmosphere that peculiar hue, from which
this range of mountains takes its name, and to the westward
rises, almost to the very clouds, in picturesque
beauty, the historic heights at Harper’s Ferry.</p>

<p class='c006'>We had been detailed as escort to a battery of artillery,
and early on the following morning, the “crossing over”
began. The river at this point runs with great rapidity,
and the bottom at the ford, we found to be full of huge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>boulders, causing many a mishap and much labor; sometimes
a horse would go down almost out of sight, but, at
last, by swimming and wading, the crossing of the artillery
was safely effected; the men were transported over
on an old flat-boat that lay rotting, near by, on the
shore. We pushed rapidly forward to Purcillville, an
insignificant hamlet, near Snicker’s Gap.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next day being Sunday, and, for a wonder, not
being called upon for any sort of duty, was passed in a
sort of sleepy, dreamy way—a fact noticeable throughout
our whole command. Since the severe marching and
physical endurance of the past two months.</p>

<p class='c006'>Early on Monday, the 18th, our division moved down
to Snicker’s Ferry, where the enemy was posted in force
on the other side of the river. Our brigade was immediately
pushed forward, plunging into the water, which
was waist deep, we crossed over, driving the Rebels before
us, and took a position on the west bank of the
famed Shenandoah. The rest of the division soon joined
us, and our line of battle was rapidly formed. We had
thrown out a heavy line of skirmishers, as soon as the
crossing was effected, Col. Wilson taking charge of them
in person, mounted on his black charger, he rode from
one end of the line to the other, getting it firmly established,
and, though the air was thick with bullets, he escaped
unharmed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here occurred one of those unfortunate fights in which
it was the fortune of our forces so often to participate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>during the course of the war. Our lines were formed in
something of a circle on the top of a knoll extending
along the river, where, from the maneuvering of the enemy,
we could see that they were in strong force. Soon
they came charging down upon us, but our line stood
firm as a rock, and sent them whirling back into the
woods, where they re-formed their broken line, and
with reinforcements came again to the attack, shaking their
banners and yelling like mad-men, they came, but only
to recoil, broken and shattered before our deadly volleys.
Once again did they charge our unshaken line, but
to be hurled back as before.</p>

<p class='c006'>Night was now rapidly coming on, and we were anxiously
looking for the balance of our troops to cross the
river, but they did not come, and after twice getting orders,
we began slowly to recross the river.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our regiment and the 34th Massachusetts, than which
there was no braver nor more gallant regiment in the
service—were left to protect the rear, and of course,
were the last to effect the crossing, in doing which many
lives were lost, quite a number of men in the regiment
being either shot in the river or drowned in its rushing
waters.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lieut. Willoughby, of company F, was wounded, and
Lieut. Williams, of company B, was killed, while fording
the river—a noble-hearted fellow, mourned by all who
knew him. Orderly Davis, of company A, mortally
wounded while firing the last shot at the enemy, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>carried to an Island midway of the stream, where he was
left to die—but before his brave spirit winged its flight to
that other camping ground, he placed under a log by his
side, his watch, pocket-book, knife, and all of his trinkets,
and the next day when his comrades returned to the
spot to give him burial, these things were missed; when
the log being accidentally misplaced, his treasures were
disclosed, and afterwards were sent home to his wife.
Knowing his hours were few, lying there alone, dying,
with only God’s Angels watching over him, his last
thoughts were of the dear ones at home, secreting his effects
as narrated, hoping them to fall into the hands of his friends,
that his wife and babies might receive this, his last, his
dying gift. We often read of heroism upon the battle field
when the blood is up, with flags waving in the breeze, bright
bayonets gleaming on every side, and the thundering of
cannon crashing through the air. But thus to die alone,
to fill an unknown and forgotten grave, with the sad
murmurings of the Shenandoah chaunting its endless requiem
around his resting-place, and leave such evidence
of coolness and christian fortitude in meeting the grim
messenger face to face, is a kind of bravery before which
that of the battlefield pales into insignificance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sergeant Hart, our color bearer, was shot in the arm
while going down the bank. Adjutant McCracken
standing near by, relieved him of the flag and started
across the river, but getting into deep water, was compelled
to let it go in the rushing waters, in order to save
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>himself. The flag however was recovered soon after, it
having lodged in a fallen tree just below, and after being
borne through several other engagements, was sent to
Columbus, where, a mere shred, it now hangs in the
Arm and Trophy Department of the State.</p>

<p class='c006'>Why we were not supported in this engagement was
always a mystery to us, unless our finding the enemy in
force determined Gen. Wright that it would not be prudent
to cross over more troops, and so issued the order
for us to fall back.</p>

<p class='c006'>We found the 6th and 19th corps’ drawn up in good
shape, and as we marched through their lines, our little
division did not present a very flattering appearance—as
every man was wet “through and through,” and generally
covered with mud, from climbing the clay river
banks. We encamped under the shelter of a dense
woods, just back from the river, and proceeded to dry
our clothing, and get our guns and ammunition in condition
for service.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 19th, the 6th and 19th corps’ moved off in the direction
of Washington, and we heard, that they had got
up another scare at the capital. The next day after the
departure of these troops, we again crossed the river
higher up, at the regular ford, in a drenching rain storm;
we waded the river, which, at this point, was about two
feet deep, and it was quite laughable to see some of the
men attempt to keep dry. We went into camp just on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the other side, remaining there until the next day, when
we pushed on to Winchester.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 24th, about noon, signs of the enemy’s approach
became evident, and our forces were soon in
position, and at 2 o’clock a fierce battle was once more
raging around the valley city. For several hours the
field was fiercely contested, when, being overpowered on
all sides, our troops were compelled to fall back, saving
all our trains, and taking with us the most of our wounded.
It will be remembered that we were opposed by the
same army that we measured strength with over the same
ground one month later, after being reinforced by the
6th and 19th corps’, with Gen. Sheridan commanding.
In this engagement the gallant Gen. Mulligan fell, fighting
at the head of his division, just as the day was lost.</p>

<p class='c006'>No shoes or clothing had been issued to our men
since the Hunter raid, and many of our boys were still
bare-foot, for such of them, that retreat, was simply terrible;
many of them unable to walk upon their blood-clotted
feet, were compelled to fall out and were taken
prisoners, most of whom died afterwards from cruel
treatment in Andersonville. We made a stand at Bunker
Hill, holding the enemy in check until early next morning,
then fell back to Martinsburg, skirmishing all the way.
We held the town until all the military stores at this
point, together with our sick and wounded, had been put
into cars and started for Cumberland, on the Baltimore
&amp; Ohio Railroad; when with our train we fell back to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Williamsport, fording the Potomac. On the morning of
the 26th we pushed on through Sharpsburg, thence to
Pleasant Valley, on to Harper’s Ferry, where we again
crossed the Potomac, and went into camp on the 28th
at Hall Town, four miles distant.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus in sixteen days had we, in our worn-out condition,
many of the men without shoes or proper clothing,
fought in two severe engagements and marched one
hundred and ninety miles. Here we made out clothing
and pay rolls, and on July 30th, while issuing clothing
to the men, received orders to march to the defense of
the Capitol, and immediately started back into Maryland.
None who were on that march will soon forget
the intense heat of that July day; it is said that over
one hundred of the army died from sun stroke, and
many more were seriously effected. After marching
around through Maryland for four or five days, it was
discovered that the “Washington scare” had been over
estimated, and on the 5th of August we went into camp
at Monocacy, where our division was ordered out at
sun-down to witness the execution of a deserter from the
23d O. V. I., being the first and only time during the
war that our regiment was called upon to witness such
a scene.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>While the regiment was lying at Pleasant Valley,
Gen. Sheridan assumed command of the entire department
of West Virginia, which was hereafter to be called
the Department of the Shenandoah. A new state of
warfare was now inaugurated. The Rebels of the
beautiful valley were to be taught a lesson which they
would never forget, and victory was hereafter to perch upon
our banners. Everything now assumed an air of business
and preparation; clothing and shoes, which were
much needed by the men, were issued in abundance, and
our boys again felt that spirit of confidence which is a
sure prelude to success. On Monday, August 8th, we
crossed the river at Harper’s Ferry, and encamped on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>the banks of the Shenandoah, near Hall-Town; remaining
there until the 10th, when we again started up
the valley; encamping at night near Berryville. The
next day we marched up the river through a wild, picturesque
region of country; it was a very warm day, and
the men suffered greatly for the want of water. We
encamped about eighteen miles from our start of the
morning. The next day we changed our direction to the
right until we struck the valley pike at Middletown,
where we found that our cavalry had been pushing the
Rebels down the road from Martinsburg. We went into
camp about three miles from Cedar Creek, and during
the four days we remained here, our boys subsisted
mainly upon “roasting ears,” we having arrived just in
time to help the good people of that section enjoy this
luxury. On the evening of the 26th we received orders
to move, and just before starting, Col. Wilson was taken
very ill—the result of an overdose of morphine, administered
by Surgeon Hyatt, and the command of the regiment
devolved upon Capt. Chamberlin. We moved
back to Winchester that night, and the next day we
marched to Berryville. All this time Col. Wilson was
very sick, and of course could receive but little care;
but he was now taken to a farm-house near by, and
every attention paid him possible. The Colonel finally
recovered, though it was a long time before he was himself
again.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 18th we moved back to a small place called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Clifton, remaining there until the 20th; on this day our
regiment reported three hundred and sixty men and
six officers for duty; Capt. Kellogg, of Company E,
and Lieut. Leonard, of Company D, joining us that
evening.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next morning the regiment went out as guard to
a forage train, and while loading our wagons, heavy skirmishing,
with the occasional firing of artillery, was heard
near by, and we hurried back to camp, only to find it
deserted. After considerable traveling, we found our
proper place in the line of battle which had been formed,
and went to work building a breast work of rails, which
we had to carry quite a distance. Early in the evening
we moved out to support a battery in our front, but as
night came on the firing ceased, and about 11 o’clock a
retrograde movement commenced in the direction of
Harper’s Ferry; and after marching about fourteen
miles, we came to the place where our troops were going
into camp. Our brigade commander, who was with our
regiment, had, in the darkness, lost the rest of his brigade,
and we had the honor of escorting him around
hunting for it. At last, in disgust, he told us to go into
camp—where we had a mind to—an order which we
very quickly obeyed.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the following morning skirmishing was again going
on in our front, and before noon we were at work fortifying,
and by night our division was strongly entrenched.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>We remained here until the 28th, and during the first
three days we were here a continuous roar of skirmish
firing was going on along the whole line; if a soldier
from either side showed his head above his pile of rails,
he was sure to be made a target of. The officers of our
division tried to stop this kind of warfare, but with little
effect, until the 25th, when the 123d was sent out on
the line in front of our brigade; when by the exertion
of our commanding officer, skirmish firing, which had
been almost continuous from both sides, was stopped by
our regiment, and when it was noticed by the Rebels
that we were not doing the usual amount of firing, they
also ceased, and we were soon on easy terms with them,
trading papers, coffee for tobacco, etc.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our example soon became generally adopted, and
firing ceased along the whole front. We were highly
complimented by Gen. Thoburne for the prompt manner
in which the nuisance was stopped.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the morning of the 27th it was discovered that the
Rebels had abandoned their position, and we received
orders to be in readiness to move without baggage, and
with three days rations, to last four days. Early on the
28th, we started, but stopped near Charleston, where we
remained until September 3d. The time was occupied
in making clothing and pay-rolls, and on the 31st of
August, the regiment was mustered and received four
months’ pay.</p>

<p class='c006'>We broke camp early on the morning of September
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>3d, moving up the valley in three columns, the 6th corps
having the right, the 19th corps the center, and Gen.
Crook’s command, to which we belonged, having the
left. Our command reached Berryville, arriving about
noon. Pickets were sent out, and being attacked, our
division was sent forward to their support, in doing which
our regiment, or six companies of them, the others being
on picket, became heavily engaged with a brigade of
Rebels, whom we run into a<a id='t88'></a> cornfield almost before we
were aware of their presence. We gave them three or
four volleys, when they came charging down upon us
and we were forced to retire, losing four killed and
fifteen wounded. As soon as we reached our reserves
our line was halted and we laid there on our arms all
night, expecting the fight would be renewed in the morning.
It rained most of the night, and was quite cold;
taking it all in all, we had a pretty rough night of it.
Our corps was assigned its position on the line in the
morning and commenced building “breast works”, and
right here we might say that these, like all the others
we built during the war, were never fired over, it always
being our privilege to be the attacking party. We remained
here for some time, working on the fortifications
and doing picket duty. On the 7th, Lieut. Col.
Kellogg came up and took command of the regiment,
Capt. Chamberlin having been in command since August
17th.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Colonel had been sick in hospital, and had quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>an adventure while on his way from the ferry to the regiment,
in company with a surgeon in charge of an ambulance
train, and without escort. All went well until
within seven or eight miles of the army, when it now being
about 5 o’clock P. M., they were suddenly pounced
upon in front and rear by a gang of bushwhackers, under
command of the redoubtable “Mosby;” fortunately the
Colonel and Surgeon were pretty well ahead of the train,
and the main body of the Rebels had came on the road
behind them, so putting spur to their horses, they dashed
down the road, brushing the Rebs in their immediate
pathway aside, and away up the pike at a break-neck
speed they went, when in about twenty minutes, reaching
a cavalry out-post, Col. Cellogg persuaded the Sergeant
in charge, with about twenty men, to go back with
him and recapture the train. Flying over the ground,
they were soon upon them, and going in with a yell,
they scattered the “Jonnies” in every direction, recovering
the entire train before the Rebels could get it
turned around and in shape to get away, thus saving
to the government many thousands of dollars, and to the
army a much needed train of ambulances. Had Col.
Kellogg waited until a strong force of cavalry could have
been secured, as most officers would have done, it would
have been too late, and Mosby, with his plunder, well
out of reach in the mountains. We now had a splendid
army, and knew we could whip the Rebs at any time,
and the wonder throughout the army was “why don’t we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>do it.” We afterwards learned that Gen. Grant’s orders
were to avoid a decisive engagement if possible, as it
would not do, at that time, for this army to suffer a
defeat.</p>

<p class='c006'>Captain Shawhan joined the regiment on the 12th,
and on the 15th, Col. Kellogg receiving a “sick leave,”
went to his home, the command of the regiment again
devolving upon Capt. Chamberlin.</p>

<p class='c006'>September 16th our army was visited by Gen. Grant,
in order to confer in person with Gen. Sheridan. The
General saw that all Gen. Sheridan wanted was permission
to strike—it was given in two words—“go in”—and
we went.</p>

<p class='c006'>The army was in motion before daylight on Monday
the 19th, and before night closed upon us, the famous
battle of “Opequan” was fought and won. We took
the road in the direction of Winchester, the 6th and 19th
corps’ having the advance. Firing commenced as soon
as we were fairly started, and increased in volume as we
advanced, to that roar which indicates the heavy engagement.
We reached the Perryville Pike where it crosses
the Opequan Creek, about 10 o’clock A. M., where
we were held in reserve until about 2 o’clock P. M.,
when we were ordered up. We crossed the creek,
and made our way along a narrow, woody gorge up to
the front.</p>

<p class='c006'>The road was crowded with artillery, ammunition
wagons, and ambulances, also with prisoners and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>wounded men moving to the rear, in fact, it was so
choked up that it was with difficulty we picked our way
through the debris.</p>

<p class='c006'>We at length reached a ravine, in front of which was a
narrow strip of woods, and along its southern edge a division
of the 19th corps was posted, and seemingly,
heavily engaged. We were rapidly massed in column by
brigade, with ours in front, and immediately moved forward,
relieving this portion of the 19th corps, and as
soon as they were massed and ready, the bugle sounded
the advance, and we moved forward on the double-quick.
Now commenced one of the most exciting
charges ever participated in by a large army; for over
two miles we drove them, over stone fences, up hills and
down ravines, until about 4 o’clock P. M., when, our
cavalry getting on their flank, they, no longer making
any stand, went flying down the valley with Averill’s
and Merritt’s gallant riders in hot pursuit. The 123d
was the first regiment over the fortifications and into the
city of Winchester. We went into the fight with six officers
and one hundred and eighty-two men, losing seven
men killed and three officers—Capt. Shawhan, Lieutenants
Snyder and Johnson—and forty-two men wounded,
receiving special praise from Gen. Thoburn, for our gallant
conduct.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this truly great battle we captured nearly three
thousand prisoners, five guns, and nine battle flags. Gen.
Sheridan’s dispatch announcing the victory, was, “We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>have just sent them whirling through Winchester, and
we are after them to-morrow. The army behaved splendidly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The next day we moved up the valley to Strasburg;
where on the hills beyond, the Rebel army, in a naturally
strong position, had fortified themselves, determined
again to try the issue of battle.</p>

<p class='c006'>We were maneuvered around some until the morning of
the 22d, when the two divisions of our corps were
moved back about three miles, where getting under cover,
we changed our direction to the left, up the side of
the mountain, and then silently stole towards the Rebel
lines. We crept along the mountain until about 3 o’clock
P. M., when getting squarely on their flank, our lines
were formed for the charge, but while doing it we were
discovered by the enemy, who immediately opened on
us with shot and shell; but it was too late, the order
was at once issued,  “Double-quick, charge!” and we
were upon them before they could make any preparations
to receive us, capturing their artillery, and turning
their left completely; we went sweeping down their
breast-works, like the wind, every man yelling at the top
of his voice; at the same time that we charged them on
their left, the 6th and 19th corps’ attacked them in front.</p>

<p class='c006'>Routed at every point they were soon in wild retreat,
the ground being literally strewn with arms and accoutrements.
The cavalry kept up the pursuit throughout
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>the night, keeping the fleeing army on the jump for
twenty-five miles.</p>

<p class='c006'>The victory was complete—eleven hundred prisoners
and sixteen pieces of artillery falling into our hands, and
accomplished with but very little loss to us; our regiment
losing seven wounded.</p>

<p class='c006'>We <i>bivouacked</i> on our arms, where darkness overtook
us, being completely tired out with the day’s work. Here
occurred one of those accidents, which, from its sheer
needlessness, caused a cold shudder to run over all. The
34th Massachusetts of our brigade, camped in our immediate
vicinity, and while all was bustle and confusion,
their Major, was shot by the accidental discharge of a
musket, at the time, he was standing with a group of officers
around a hastily constructed camp-fire.</p>

<p class='c006'>It seemed hard, that after having gallantly and safely
passed through so much hard fighting, thus to be stricken
down, while quietly discussing the day’s battle.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the morning the army pushed rapidly forward,
leaving our brigade to collect the debris, care for the
prisoners and wounded and bury the dead.</p>

<p class='c006'>At 10 o’clock A. M., on the 24th, we moved on after
the army, through Woodstock, Edinburg and Mt. Jackson,
going into camp two miles beyond, making a twenty-seven
mile march; pretty good considering that the
regiment marched on the flank of the train all day, and
until 10 o’clock P. M., through brush, over fences, up
and down hills, and sometimes fording streams, causing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>every one to feel glad when the order came to go into
camp wherever a good place could be found.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next morning we went on through New Market,
where we wandered around some over the ground, of our
fight here of May 15th. The trees and fences plainly
giving evidence of the terrible musketry fire on that day.
Resuming our march we went on through Harrisonburg,
where we found the army encamped.</p>

<p class='c006'>While here we made out “Muster and Pay-Rolls,” and
straightened up our papers generally. The regiment had
two hundred and fifty eight men, and four officers for
duty, Capt. Chamberlin in command, with Lieutenants
Husted, Bevington and Keyes under him.</p>

<p class='c006'>On October 4th Lieut. Meiggs, of Gen. Sheridan’s
staff, was bushwhacked while making observations of the
roads in our vicinity, in retaliation for which, Sheridan
ordered that every house and barn within five miles of
the murder should be burned to the ground. This order
was afterwards revoked, so far as the little town of Dayton
was concerned, which came within the prescribed
limits.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 6th of October we again broke camp, and started
back down the valley. Our brigade was in the rear
of the infantry, and directly behind us came the cavalry,
who had orders to destroy all barns, stacks of grain, and
everything that could support a Rebel Army. The
smoke that filled the valley as far as we could see to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>rear, was conclusive proof that the order was being executed
to the letter.</p>

<p class='c006'>We reached Cedar Creek on the 11th and went into
camp on the east side, taking our position on the left of
the 19th corps, and here we held our first election, in
accordance with the law, allowing soldiers in the field to
vote. Col. Kellogg and Capt. Kellogg came up just in
time to exercise their elective franchise. Capt Chamberlin,
who had ably commanded the regiment since the
15th of September, was now relieved, and Lieut. Col.
Kellogg, assumed command. We were all glad to see
his genial phiz once more for all knew him, the kind,
true friend, the brave and accomplished officer.</p>

<p class='c006'>We now had six officers in the line for duty, more than
at any other time since the Hunter Raid.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 13th our entire regiment went on picket, a portion
of the line being across the creek, when, to the surprise
of every one, the enemy opened fire from a masked
battery, and shelled our camp for about two hours,
when the 1st and 3d brigades of our division were sent
out to look into the matter. They soon found the Rebels
in strong force, when orders were sent for the brigades
to return, but the Adjutant General, after having delivered
the order to the 3d brigade, had his horse shot under
him, and failing to give the order to our brigade,
they kept on advancing, until they were heavily engaged,
and very soon were forced back, being overpowered by a
greatly superior force. Our brigade lost heavily, Col.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Wells, commanding, and his Adjutant General were
killed and left on the field. Our picket-line was now
changed to a skirmish-line, being reinforced by two companies
from the 116th O. V. I. We held our position firmly,
and about midnight advanced a half mile, and found that
the Rebels had fallen back. We laid here several days,
doing picket and forage duty, receiving some reinforcements
by men returning from hospitals.</p>

<p class='c006'>One day one hundred men were called for to go with
a forage train. Every precaution was used, but the Forage
Master thought there was no danger, and staying
out of reach of our protecting Springfields, was gobbled
up with one of his wagons by some bushwhackers, and
started towards “Dixie’s Land.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The rest of the train, well loaded, reached camp about
9 o’clock P. M., very tired, having traveled twenty-four
miles over mountain roads.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 18th of October the regiment, in conjunction
with the 11th Virginia, made a reconnaissance to within a
half mile of the enemy’s camp. We could plainly see
them lying around under the trees, but nothing to indicate
the movement that, on the morrow, was to startle
the nation, and shake the army of the Shenandoah to the
very centre.</p>

<p class='c006'>At half past 4 on the morning of October 19th, the
regiment was routed out by a straggling picket fire in
our front; the word was passed along that the enemy
were advancing, and the men quietly fell into line along
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>the breast-work. The other brigades, however, failed to
observe the warning, or were too slow in “falling in.”
The Rebels easily turned the right of our corps, getting
over the works with little or no opposition, many of the
men being still asleep in their tents.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some resistance, however, was made by our brigade,
the only one in the division not surprised; we fell slowly
back, the broken ranks of the other brigades, rallying
upon our line; we soon came upon the 19th corps that,
by this time had got into line, and, meeting their first
division, we made a good stand, giving them several well
directed volleys, that checked their advance, but soon
being flanked on the left, were compelled again to give
way; here our division commander, Gen. Thoburn, and
his Adjutant General, were killed. A running fight was
now kept up for about four miles, when meeting the 6th
corps drawn up in line, with their artillery in position,
the retreat was checked. The 19th corps took position
on their left, our corps joining their’s, with a good body
of cavalry on our left. Up to this hour it had been the
darkest day of our army life; flushed with victory in two
great battles within a month, supposing ourselves invincible
against anything in the valley, thus to be driven
almost in a rout from our works, was a little too much
for our philosophy. But now retreat was no longer
thought of; Gen. Wright of the 6th corps had our lines
well established, and the enemy decidedly checked, when
Gen. Sheridan arrived on the field, he having ridden from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Winchester, “Twenty miles away,” since the battle
commenced. New life seemed at once to animate the
whole army. Some slight changes were made in the line,
particularly with the cavalry—when the order was given,
“Forward along the line,” and away we went, with a
heavy line of skirmishers, armed with repeating rifles,
supported by strong lines of infantry, against whose
steady and determined advance there was no resistance.
In less than an hour the Rebel horde was flying back over
the ground they had so lately traversed, flushed with success.
The cavalry now swooped down from their positions,
on the right and on the left, and as the enemy’s
lines were turned, and in wild retreat, the scene that ensued
along that valley pike beggars description.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was a grand sight to see that army, lately shattered
and stricken nigh unto annihilation, thus reform their
columns and boldly move out to the charge; in all the
battles of the great rebellion, no parallel is presented.
Back through our camps which they had swept in the
morning, the beaten Rebels ran, throwing away their
guns and knapsacks, and everything that in any way impeded
their headlong flight.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cavalry kept up the pursuit for sixteen miles, recapturing
all of our trains, and capturing the greater
portion of their’s.</p>

<p class='c006'>We stacked our muskets behind the works occupied in
the morning, and slept that night, as we had fought that
day, without food.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>There is scarce a doubt that if we could have had two
hours more of daylight, the Rebel army would have been
totally annihilated, as it was we captured forty-nine
pieces of artillery, besides retaking the ones taken from
us in the morning, and over two-thousand prisoners.
Our loss was very heavy, being over six-thousand in
killed and wounded; that of the enemy being much
less. The loss in our regiment was one killed, fifteen
wounded and thirteen missing.</p>

<p class='c006'>The change from the gloom of disaster that hung over
our army in the morning, to complete and undisputed victory
in the evening, cannot easily be described. The
rebellion for this portion of the confederacy was effectually
closed. And when we remember the armies, great
and small, that have at different times marched up and
down this famous valley; the many hard fought battles
for the mastery of its soil; its importance in the great
drama of the rebellion is plain. Here the sons of nearly
every State in the Union are sleeping the last long
sleep: some in burial places set apart for their repose,
while many, many more, quietly rest in unmarked and
forgotten graves, the victims of a wicked, cruel and uncalled
for attempt upon the life of the purest and best
government upon the face of the earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>We encamped at night upon our old ground, but without
tents, blankets or rations, the Rebels having made
clean work of our camp, and as most of the men left their
haversacks where they grasped their muskets, but very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>few had anything to eat, though fighting hard from five
in the morning till seven at night has a tendency to
make one hungry.</p>

<p class='c006'>We changed our camp the next morning to a more
sheltered one; anything but refreshed from our sleep on
the cold, damp ground.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the course of a few days we drew blankets, overcoats
and some tents. Some of the officers rigged up
quarters from pieces of old tents, wagon covers and old
boards, not especially handsome; but they answered to
write in, and after a great battle there was always plenty
of that to do. It was an army saying that the trouble in
fixing up papers after a great defeat was only exceeded by
that occasioned by a great victory.</p>

<p class='c006'>We remained here for some time, doing nothing, as
there was nothing to do. The valley was absolutely
ours.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 28th, the army was paid off, and of course
money was plenty, much to the satisfaction of the suttlers,
as well as the boys.</p>

<p class='c006'>On November 9th we moved back to near Kearnstown,
about five miles from Winchester. It was here that
“Little Phil” received his Major-General’s commission
in the United States Army, just one month previous he
having received a Brigadier-General’s commission in the
same, winning the one at Winchester, September 19th,
and the other at Cedar Creek, October 19th.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 16th of November we had dress-parade for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>first time since May 1st. Over six months of hard field
service, in which there was no room for parade or drill.
We had borne our part in the engagements at New Market,
Piedmont, Lynchburg, Snicker’s Ferry, Winchester,
Berryville, Opequan, Fisher’s Hill, and Cedar Creek,
losing forty in killed, ninety-seven in wounded and twenty-four
missing. Of officers we had one killed and four
wounded, being one-half the number we had for duty at
any one time. We had marched eleven hundred miles,
and for the most part under a broiling sun and on short
rations.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 18th, our brigade was ordered to Opequan
bridge, to guard the railroad at that point, where, on
the 24th, we received our portion of the ten thousand
Thanksgiving turkeys, sent by our noble State to her
sons in the field. While remaining here it rained the
most of the time, the weather being quite cold.</p>

<p class='c006'>December 14th, Adjutant McCracken returned to the
regiment, and on the 17th, the officers of the brigade,
with the band of the 34th Massachusetts came over to
our headquarters, and a general good time was indulged
in. Not, perhaps, in strict accordance with the views of
the would-be reformers of this day, but, nevertheless, all
were happy; every one was congratulated on being
alive, and fair fortune was invoked to continue propitious
for each and every one. We had now made preparations
for remaining here during the winter. The men had
built good quarters out of logs, procured from the woods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>near at hand, and the officers had erected quite a house
from similar material, when, on December 18th, orders
came transferring our division to the army of the James,
in front of Richmond.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>
  <h2 id='VIII' class='c004'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>FROM OPEQUAN BRIDGE TO THE SURRENDER OF LEE, INCLUDING HATCHER’S RUN AND HIGH BRIDGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>On the 19th of December we left our log cabins so laboriously
constructed, with some regrets, and possibly
with some hard words, but a soldier’s life is one of obedience,
and, in a few hours, our nice quarters at Opequan
were forgotten, and we were ready to build others as
uncomplainingly as we had these, wherever our camp
would be pitched. It was a drizzly, cold day, and for
some unknown reason we were very slow in getting
started.</p>

<p class='c006'>But at length, about 2 o’clock P. M., we were all
on board the cars and on our way to Washington, where
we arrived early the next morning. In about two hours
we embarked on board the steamer Keyport and started
down the Potomac.</p>

<p class='c006'>We sailed under sealed orders, not knowing for a certainty
where we were going until after passing Fortress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Monroe, though our destination had been pretty well
guessed.</p>

<p class='c006'>We experienced very rough weather while on the voyage,
and a great many of the men were sea-sick, and
we were compelled to anchor for the night off the Rhappahannock
river, the steamer having four feet of water
in the hold. It was a disgrace to our country thus to
jeopardize the lives of men. We, of course, had no option
in the matter; on this vessel we were to sail and that
ended the matter; if the steamer had gone to the bottom
with us—and it was a wonder that she did not—the
verdict would have been as usual—a terrible loss of
life, and no one to blame. But this was only one of ten
thousand cases, where the men who were in the field,
nobly battling for the nation’s life, suffered through the
wicked greed of gain in others.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 22d we got under-way early in the day, passing
Fortress Monroe on the right and “Rip Raps” on
the left.</p>

<p class='c006'>The angry waves dashing against their sides on that
icy December morning, caused them to appear anything
but inviting spots to us, accustomed to soldiering among
green hills and grassy hillsides.</p>

<p class='c006'>Early the next morning we disembarked at Jones
Landing, near City Point, and marched about five miles
in a northerly direction, taking our position in the line
on the right of the 24th corps, to which we were now
attached as the independent division, Gen. John W.
Turner commanding.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>We passed a cold and sleepless night, there being
about four inches of snow on the ground, and wood very
scarce.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our train did not get up until nearly morning. The
next morning we went to work on our camp in good
earnest. From a wood, about a half mile distant, the
men split out slabs and carried them, on their shoulders,
notching them together in regular backwoods style, covering
them with their “dog-tents,” making houses large
enough to accommodate from six to eight men.</p>

<p class='c006'>They then built a fire place in each out of sticks laid
up in cob-house fashion, plastering heavily with clay
both on the inside and outside, and made ourselves quite
comfortable for the winter.</p>

<p class='c006'>The weather was very disagreeable all through the
months of January and February, raining or snowing
nearly every day, keeping us in slush nearly all the time.
Firing was constantly going on at the front, and during
the day hearing cannonading was the regular order, but
no general engagement occurred during the winter.
While here inspections were quite frequent, and very
rigid, and great pains were taken with the appearance and
discipline of the regiment. We were under arms and at
the breast-works every morning at daybreak. Many
promotions were made during the winter, Capt. Chamberlin
to Major, 1st Lieutenants Davis, McCracken,
Snyder and Bevington to Captains, and 2d Lieutenants
Husted, Pumphrey, Sowers and Keyes to 1st Lieutenants.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>The last being soon after detailed on brigade
staff.</p>

<p class='c006'>Captains Randolph, Rosenbaum and Robbins, and
Lieutenants Davis, Acker and Boyce, joined the regiment,
they having made their escape from “Rebel prisons”
during the fall and winter, this being the first we
had seen of them since the disastrous fight at Winchester,
June 15th, 1863.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sometime in March we received a new stand of colors,
our old ones being completely in ribbons, and Major
Chamberlin going home on a leave of absence, took them
with him to Ohio, and presented them to the Governor
for safe keeping.</p>

<p class='c006'>About the middle of March everything began to assume
a busy air throughout the army, and it was evident
that military movements would soon begin.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 25th our division received orders to be ready
to move at an hours notice, and on the night of the 27th
the orders came, and very shortly we were on the way,
crossing the James River under cover of the darkness. We
then struck off to the rear of our works for a short distance,
and then away towards our left. All night long
through that dense woods and pitchy darkness we slowly
picked our way. The road was very muddy, and the
march a tiresome one. We halted about 4 o’clock in the
morning for a short rest.</p>

<p class='c006'>Snatching a hasty breakfast at 8 o’clock, we were
again on the road, pushing on all day towards the left.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>We now became aware that Sheridan was pressing the enemy’s
right, and that we were probably on the way to
reinforce him.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the morning of the 29th we reached the position
assigned us in the vicinity of Hatcher’s Run, and remained
quietly behind the works until the next day.</p>

<p class='c006'>Early in the morning we moved out beyond the entrenchments,
and immediately the crack of musketry
announced that skirmishing had begun, but we steadily
pressed them back, through the tangled woods and
across creeks and gullies. About noon the rain commenced
falling in torrents, making our advance very
tedious.</p>

<p class='c006'>We stopped at night, and at once commenced fortifying
our position. All next day the rain continued to
pour, making it impossible for us to move our artillery,
and we were compelled to remain idle. Early on the
31st our division moved out to the attack, the regiment
being on the skirmish line, were immediately under fire,
and drove the enemy steadily back until within five
hundred yards of their entrenched position on Hatcher’s
Run. Just before a halt was ordered, the regiment
made a gallant charge, driving the Rebs from a point of
timber, capturing some prisoners and gaining a very desirable
position and maintained it against a heavy cannonade
and musketry fire throughout the day. As soon
as night came on, we set to work building breast works,
using rails and loose stones, and digging dirt with our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>bayonets, we were very soon pretty strongly entrenched.
We remained there all night, getting very little, if any,
sleep. Firing commenced early in the morning and was
kept up steadily through the day, no change, however,
being made in our position. Now by all reason of fairness
we certainly should have been relieved. We had
been on severe duty for two days, sending many of our
dead and wounded back to the rear, amply attesting the
work we had done. We had cooked nothing to eat during
the time, though the boys in the rear had sent us out hot
coffee on several occasions. But Gen. Turner sent a
special request to Col. Kellogg, who had gallantly and
in person commanded the line; asking that he remain
with his regiment, on the line, for another night. Of
course his request was complied with.</p>

<p class='c006'>At day-break the grand movement was made along
the whole line, that gave us Petersburg, and sent the
Rebels broken and shattered from their last stronghold
in Virginia.</p>

<p class='c006'>The advance was begun on our right, and as the cheers
of our troops announced their success, Col. Kellogg became
very anxious to lead his regiment against the works
in our front. Twice he sent for permission before it
came.</p>

<p class='c006'>The regiment was all ready, and at the word, leaped
over their rail pens and away for the enemies works, and
without a stop, over their defences, capturing several
hundred prisoners, two cannon and two battle flags.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>One of these battle flags is still in possession of Col.
Kellogg, at Norwalk, and the other is deposited with our
own colors at the Capital.</p>

<p class='c006'>After our division had forced their lines at Hatcher’s
Run, we joined our corps, and pressing on after the 6th
corps, swerving to the right and closing in on the enemy
around Petersburg. Just at night, our division was
selected by Gen. Gibbon, to carry by storm two large
forts on the South of the city.</p>

<p class='c006'>We were soon formed in column by brigade, with our
brigade in front. Company D, now the brigade sharpshooters,
were deployed in front. At the order, our
three brigades sprang forward to the charge at a right
shoulder shift; the sharpshooters opened a rapid fire
that was so well directed, that their guns were used with
very poor effect. Without a stop the first fort was reached,
and after ten or fifteen minutes of desperate resistance
was ours. The second one then fell with scarce a
struggle.</p>

<p class='c006'>The roar of battle was now heard along the whole
line, the enemy fighting bravely behind their works; but
at the close of that Sabbath evening we knew that the
strength of the Rebellion was broken.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the night Petersburg and Richmond was evacuated,
and the Rebel army in rapid retreat towards Danville.
Early in the morning we were in pursuit, taking
the road towards Burkesville, along the South Side road.
Gen. Ord being in command of our portion of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>army. We marched to Burkesville, arriving there at 11
o’clock on the night of the 5th, being square on Lee’s
flank, who was to the north of us and on the road towards
Farmville. The army was completely jaded, having
been on the march since early morning, and rest was
imperatively demanded. The General, however, called
for two picked regiments to go out and destroy the
bridges that cross the Appomattox, near Farmville, and
thus cut off the enemy’s retreat in that direction. The
123d Ohio and 54th Pennsylvania were selected, and
with a squadron of the 4th Massachusetts cavalry, the
whole under command of Gen. Theodore Read, at once
started. They met the head of Lee’s army near the
point designated, and at once bravely attacked them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Col. Kellogg was in command of the infantry, Gen.
Read being away with the cavalry on a reconnaissance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Deploying a heavy line of skirmishers, we stubbornly
maintained our position, though against a largely superior
force. After having repulsed them several times,
Gen. Read, knowing we could not long withstand their
rapidly increasing force, resolved to charge with his little
band of cavalry, and endeavor to cut his way through to
the main army. Gallantly that squadron rode to the assault,
many of them destined never again to hear the
bugle’s call. The brave Read was killed, and eleven
officers of his staff and cavalry killed or wounded.</p>

<p class='c006'>None of them succeeded in getting through, nor did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>any of them return to us. Still we held our ground, and
as the Rebels marched out beyond our flanks, more men
were deployed, until finally, both regiments were a mere
skirmish line. For several hours this unequal contest
was waged, till at last the boys began to get out of ammunition,
and very soon that cry became general.</p>

<p class='c006'>Col. Kellogg, who had been hoping all along that the
army would come to his rescue, now saw there was no
use longer to resist, and ordered the line to fall back
slowly and in as good order as possible, thinking that
some of the command, at least, might escape through the
woods.</p>

<p class='c006'>But as soon as they saw our line breaking back, they
swooped down upon us in great force, and in few moments
both regiments were prisoners. We lost a good many
men in this engagement. Capt. Randolph was shot
through the breast by a cavalryman, after having surrendered.</p>

<p class='c006'>This gallant little fight of these two regiments received
honorable mention by Gen. Grant, in his report of the
war. He says that their brave and stubborn resistance
at this point, checked Lee’s retreat long enough to enable
Gen. Ord to get up with his main force, compelling
Lee to intrench himself, thus causing great delay in the
enemy’s movements.</p>

<p class='c006'>The regiment, or so many of them as did not make
their escape after their capture, remained prisoners until
Lee’s surrender at Appomattox Court House—a period of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>two days—but time enough for the Rebels to “go
through” our boys, stripping them of everything valuable,
taking even their hats and shoes. In striking contrast to the
treatment they received at our hands after their surrender,
when scarcely a Reb was allowed to start on his
homeward tramp without a well-filled haversack and
canteen.</p>

<p class='c006'>The regiment at once came back to the division, but
in the treaty agreed upon, being counted as paroled
prisoners, were ordered to report at Parole Camp, Annapolis
as such.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Rebel Army of Northern Virginia had surrendered.
And on that quiet Sabbath evening as the lightning flashed
the intelligence from city to hamlet, the church bells
rang out the glad tidings over the free North, and the
Nation thanked the God of battles that the end for which
we had suffered and struggled so long, had come. For
four long years had these two mighty armies met in conflict
and contested for the mastery.</p>

<p class='c006'>Their dead lie all along the valley from the Potomac
to Lynchburg; they are sleeping where they fell, at
Antietam and Gettysburg, on the heights of Fredericksburgh,
and through the dark thickets of the Wilderness.
They lie in the dark forests’ of the Peninsula all the way
up to Deep Bottom, and around Petersburg. Along
the tangled morass near Hatcher’s Run, and the Weldon
Road, their graves mark the fierce conflict. Brave Old
Army of the Potomac, long suffering, gallantly fighting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>your reward has come; never again will the boasted army
of Northern Virginia meet you in equal conflict; yours is
the victory and “fairly won.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>On the 12th of April the regiment left Appomattox for
Burkesville Junction, the road was filled with “Johnnies”
on their way home, and the greater portion of them were
heartily glad that the war was over, even though they
had to see the flag of the lost cause folded forever.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next morning we left the Junction on board a
train of freight cars for City Point, fifty-two miles distant.
At that place we first learned of the assassination
of President Lincoln. It excited the most profound
grief among all to hear of his death, and in such a manner,
just at the close, as it were, of the Great Rebellion.
At first it seemed as though it was impossible for us to
realize the truth of the report; but it being confirmed by
the War Department, we were reluctantly compelled to
believe it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our men were all greatly elated over the surrender of
Lee and the probable termination of the war; which fact
only seemed to cause a greater revulsion of feeling at the
news of the death of our now lamented President. If he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>could have been permitted to witness the final end of the
great struggle through which we were passing, in which
we were endeavoring to sustain the power of our Republican
form of Government, and preserve our free institutions;
how gratifying it would have been to all concerned.
But this was not to be. Nevertheless he passed
away, “With malice toward none, but charity toward
all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Just after leaving Burkesville we met Capt. Chamberlin
returning to the regiment from leave of absence, and
Maj. Walker, Paymaster, who was on his way to the
front to pay the troops in our division.</p>

<p class='c006'>At City Point the regiment embarked on a steamer for
Annapolis, arriving there during the forenoon of the 17th,
going into quarters at College Green Barracks, where
clothing was issued to the men, and they got cleaned up
and rested; and on the 21st, in pursuance of orders received
to report at Camp Chase, we were loaded on a
train of box cars, and started for Ohio by the way of the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad. We moved very slowly,
not exceeding eight miles an hour, passing Martinsburg
on the 22d, Grafton on the 23d, Bellaire and Zanesville
on the 24th, reaching Columbus at 9 o’clock P. M. that
night. We went into quarters at Tod Barracks, and
the next day we marched to Camp Chase, where we remained
some time, awaiting the order for “muster out.”</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 29th President Lincoln’s funeral cortege reached
Columbus, on its way to Springfield, Illinois. One hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>and fifty men of our regiment were detailed as guard
at the State House, while his remains were lying there in
state. All day long a constant procession was filing
through the State House, to take a last view of our “departed
Lincoln.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The officers were now busy preparing Muster-Rolls,
and on the 30th the regiment was mustered.</p>

<p class='c006'>While in camp here, many of the officers and men visited
their homes, all very anxious for the day of our Muster-out
to arrive.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 31st of May, it having been decided that we
could no longer be considered paroled prisoners, arms
were again issued to the men. This they objected to
strongly, fearing that it was only a prelude to an order
for duty at some other point; and now, that the war was
over, the regiment preferred  going home to playing soldier
at some post.</p>

<p class='c006'>Finally, on the 2d of June, a telegram was received
from the War Department, ordering the 123d to be
Mustered-out as soon as the necessary Rolls could be
prepared.</p>

<p class='c006'>Oh the 12th, the rolls having been completed and examined
by the mustering officer, discharges filled out and
signed, Company’s A, B, C, E, and G were mustered out
and paid, and before night nearly all of them were on
their way home. The remainder of the regiment was
mustered out on the following day, and left for home;
Lieutenant H. Latimer Beck, 13th U. S. Infantry was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>mustering officer. Thus, in a few moments, as it were,
the ties that for three years had bound us together, were
sundered. And while in each breast the heart throbs
were beating to the music of “Home, Sweet Home;”
thronging memories  came trooping up from the past,
of the manly forms who went with us to the field and fell
by the wayside, of those who wasted in hospitals, or in
Rebel Prison Pens. Alas! for them, the home circle must
continue to mourn. And as gathered in groups about the
camp to say the last good-bye; manly tears would come
for those who were of our number once, but were now
borne on the grand “muster-roll” in that other camping-ground.</p>

<p class='c006'>During our three years of service, the regiment had
marched two-thousand one hundred and eighty-four
miles, had traveled by rail one thousand five hundred
and thirty-one miles, and by boat one thousand and seventeen
miles. Making a grand total of five thousand seven
hundred and thirty-two miles.</p>

<p class='c006'>The regiment, besides participating in many skirmishes
in the valley of minor importance, were in the
following general engagements:</p>

<p class='c006'>Winchester, June 13th, 14th and 15th, ’63; New
Market, May 15th, ’64; Piedmont, June 5th, ’64;
Lynchburg, June 17th and 18th, ’64; Snicker’s Ford,
July 19th, ’64; Winchester, July 24th, ’64; Berryville,
September 3d, ’64; Opequan, September 19th, ’64;
Fisher’s Hill, September 22d, ’64; Cedar Creek, October
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>19th, ’64; Petersburg and Hatcher’s Run, from
March 30th to April 2d, ’65,  and High Bride or Farmville,
April 6th, ’65,  a record of which any regiment may
well be proud.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>After our surrender on the morning of June 15th,
1863, to Col. Walker, commanding the famous “Old
Stonewall Brigade,” we were taken to where the morning
fight had taken place, and were permitted to lie
down and rest. After remaining there a couple of hours
we were marched into Winchester, halting there a few
moments, and were then taken over to the Fort. A
couple of tents were then put up for the accommodation
of the commissioned officers, but which failed to prevent
the wind from annoying us very much by blowing sand
in from all directions. Wearied and worn out, and having
eaten nothing during the day, we were compelled to
lie down at night without even a “hard-tack” to refresh
us. Next morning, about 9 o’clock, a few pounds
of meat was distributed among us, shortly after which
the officers were separated from the enlisted men and
marched over to the Court House. Late in the evening
we received some bread and meat, but previously, Capt.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Chamberlin had received a basket of provisions kindly tendered
by some good Union loving Quaker ladies of the
city, which he distributed among our officers, and for
which they will ever hold those ladies in grateful remembrance.
The officers remained there until 4 o’clock
P. M., of the following day, when they were drawn up
in line, the roll called, and after being supplied with
blankets, our party, consisting of one hundred and eight
commissioned officers, started on our march to Richmond,
under charge of Capt. Wingfield, 58th Va. (Confederate),
and his company. That evening we marched
eleven miles, and laid down on the ground for the night
about 10 o’clock. Thursday we marched twelve miles,
lying by for three or four hours in the middle day, when
flour and meat were issued to us, and we set to work baking
up our flour into cakes. The men overtook us here,
but we were not allowed to communicate with them.
It rained heavily in the afternoon, completely drenching
us through, and at night we were obliged to take up our
quarters in an old log stable, which was more thoroughly
invested by fleas than was particularly pleasant or convenient
to us. Wet as we were, we laid down and attempted
to gain a few hours repose, but alas, no
chance for that desired boon. All night long the inhabitants
of the stable could be heard visiting their maledictions
on the fleas. The next day we marched nineteen
miles to Mt. Jackson, and took up our quarters for
the night in the Rebel hospital buildings. On Saturday
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>we marched sixteen miles to Lincoln Springs, where we
had a pleasant place to camp for the night. On Sunday
we marched twenty-one miles. Col. Wilson, Adjt.
Blair, Capt. Rings, Capt. Chamberlin and Lieut. Pumphrey,
about noon hired a man, with a one horse wagon,
to haul them to Staunton, a distance of twenty-three
miles, for which privilege each of them paid five dollars
in Confederate money. And, if the man could have
carried them, he would have had more passengers at the
same price.</p>

<p class='c006'>On Monday noon we reached Staunton and remained
there two hours, and then took the cars for Richmond,
a distance of one hundred and thirty-six miles, which we
passed over during the night, arriving at our destination
about six o’clock A. M., June 23d. We were immediately
marched to the Libby Prison, where we were
searched, and our rubber coats, blankets, etc. taken from
us. The most of us managed to secrete our money, so
that it was not discovered. They gave receipts for the
money they did get, which <i>assured</i> us that it would be
<i>returned</i> to us when released. The officials informed us
we could draw it as we needed it; which, afterwards,
proved to be anything but true. They even went so far
as to take a few sheets of paper and envelopes from one
of our officers.</p>

<p class='c006'>We were then taken up stairs, and introduced to
our new quarters. The “Hotel de Libby,” as it was afterwards
facetiously called, is a large brick building, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>hundred and fifty feet in length by one hundred and five
feet in depth. It fronted on Cary and extended back to
Canal street, immediately in the rear of which was the
canal and James river. This building was, previous to
the war, occupied by Libby &amp; Son, who carried on in it
their business as ship-chandlers and grocers. Internally,
it much resembled an Ohio grain ware-house, being
three stories high, with a basement story underneath,
and divided into three tiers of rooms. The lower room
of the first tier was occupied by the various officers engaged
in the control of the Prison. The two upper
rooms were, at the time of our arrival, used for the
confinement of prisoners, and we found there Col.
Streight’s command and a few others, amounting to thirteen
hundred and sixty officers. Of the middle tier, one
room was occupied by citizen prisoners and deserters
from the Union army. The third tier was used as a
hospital for Union officers. The basement contained a
couple of cells, for the close confinement of prisoners;
the remainder of it was devoted to the use of the slaves
employed about the premises. <i>The attaches</i> of the Prison
were as follows: Capt. Turner, commandant; Lieut.
Latonche, his assistant, and, by-the-way, the most obliging
official we had anything to do with—Inspector Turner
being one of the most tyrannical beings that ever lived,
and had been a horse-jockey in one of the Northern
cities previous to the war; Ross, who attended to the
roll, and was a deserter from the North; George, (a sergeant)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>under lackey, whose duty it was to communicate
orders to the prisoners; and Charley, a mulatto, who
superintended the gang of darkies in their labors. When
we entered Libby, the upper one of the two rooms in
which we were placed contained bunks, sufficient for
those who were then in the Prison, while they used the
lower one for cooking and eating purposes.</p>

<p class='c006'>We were obliged to take up our residence in the lower
room and sleep on the floor at nights and use it to sit on
in the day time, as we had no other seats furnished except
stationary benches, at the tables.</p>

<p class='c006'>Shortly after taking up our lodgings there, we applied
for some of our money, but we met with the reply that
none of “the officers of Milroy’s command could have a
d—d cent.” Nor did we get any from them until the
1st of October. We were also informed that we would
not be allowed to purchase anything outside—as
Straight’s command was then permitted to do—so we
had to smuggle our purchases through them for some
time, until their orders were tacitly countermanded.—During
the first four weeks, while subsisting on the rations
furnished, we were often glad to pick up crumbs
from the table to satisfy our hunger.</p>

<p class='c006'>In speaking of the attaches of the prison, Gen. Johnson,
a gentleman of color, should be mentioned, although
he was a prisoner, as well as ourselves. His duty
consisted in supplying us with smoke, which he did
every morning, carrying a skillet of burning tar through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>rooms, crying “Here’s your nice smoke, without money
or price.” He also collected the soiled clothes once a
week, which he was permitted to take out to be washed,
returning them Sunday mornings, at the small charge of
three pieces for one dollar. He also, for some time, monopolized
the shaving and hair cutting, which operations
he performed at the moderate price of twenty-five cents
for the former and seventy-five cents for the latter; but
he was finally superseded by an enterprising German
Lieutenant, which compelled him to abandon this calling
and take to that of “boot-black.” The old fellow was a
regular fixture there, having been in the Prison about two
years. He was an old soldier also, having accompanied
a Pennsylvania regiment through the Mexican war.
Every morning at nine o’clock A. M. “George” made
his appearance, and, with his peculiar intonation of voice,
would cry out: “Fall in, sick, and go down;” when
those who wished to be prescribed for would huddle together
and go down on the first floor, where they were
examined by the surgeon—who was spoken of as a kind
and attentive physician—and, after making a minute of
their cases, would send them back to their rooms, excepting
those whom it was deemed necessary to send to
the hospital. In the course of two or three hours, the
medicine would be brought up and distributed to the
sick.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our enlisted men, prisoners of war who were so unfortunate
as to become sick, suffered outrageously. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>were often allowed to lie in their tents on Belle Isle, on
the wet ground, until the last moment, when they would
be brought over to the hospital to breath their last.</p>

<p class='c006'>If a description of the truth would be fit for publication,
some few particular cases could be cited that would
make any one shudder to think that there were, in this
day and age of the world, men who were so lost to all
feeling of humanity as to permit men, although their enemies,
to languish and die through sufferings such as no
pen should be called upon to describe.</p>

<p class='c006'>Once a squad of Yankees (prisoners) were leaving the
Libby building with a supply of the “so-called” rations
for the prisoners. It consisted of weak soup—better say
soiled water—in old, dirty pails, and about six ounces of
poor bread per man. We threw a few apples to them from
the windows, which they received gladly and began to
eat as if they were nearly starved.</p>

<p class='c006'>The “Libby Burlesque Troupe,” as they announced
in their programme Saturday morning, October 17th,
1863, appeared for the last time that evening, owing to
their having an engagement in Washington, for which
purpose they expected to leave on the next “Flag of
Truce Boat.” They exhibited to a crowd of Yankees
with one or two Rebels included. The performances
were very good, considering the impromptu manner in
which they were gotten up. They consisted of songs,
dances and the reading of the “Libby Ironical,” which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>was a burlesque on the “Libby Chronicle,” the weekly
issue of which had been read the forenoon previous.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the hot weather of July and August, the variety
displayed in the costume of the inmates of the Prison,
was decidedly laughable. Here you would see a man
with nothing but drawers and shirt on, there one with
drawers minus the shirt, while close by was another
with the shirt minus the drawers, and then another one
with nothing on but a linen coat (Raglan style), his
clothes being out washing, no doubt. This style of dress
was very comfortable during that kind of weather, but
when the cold days of October came, it was rather unpleasant
to be <i>compelled</i> to go around without socks or
drawers and only one shirt, which valuable article we
were obliged to dispense with occasionally for the purpose
of having them washed. We had blankets enough during
the warm weather, but when the cold nights set in, it was
discovered that while some had an abundant supply,
others had only one, and many had none at all. Repeated
complaints having been made to the Rebel officials,
Inspector Turner made his appearance one Sunday
morning and proceeded to make a division of the house,
putting prisoners in one room and blankets in the other.
He then gave to each man as he passed back into the
room, two old blankets (U. S.), but the supply not being
sufficient to go around, the remainder of the men had to
go without, and on application to the authorities we were
informed that they had no more, and consequently could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>give us no more. The bedding and clothing furnished
to our sick in the hospital was supplied by the United
States Sanitary Commission.</p>

<p class='c006'>The principal topic of conversation and excitement in
Libby was the “Exchange Question.” When we first
made our advent in that highly popular institution, it was
certainly thought that we would not possibly remain
longer than ten days or two weeks. But at the end of that
time we were still there, the Commissioners not having
met; “but just as soon as they do meet we will be exchanged
sure, and go home by the first Truce boat.”
In this manner we consoled ourselves in our misfortune.
Well, the Commissioners met, but did not agree. And
the Rebel authorities then published a statement, that they
had made a proposition to our Government, which was
so plausible on its face that we thought it would be immediately
accepted, as a matter of course, but something
intervened to prevent the exchange. And so it went on,
first one rumor and then another; first would come the
report that the surgeons and chaplains were going to
leave on the next boat, and the officers were to follow
immediately; this statement would be directly succeeded
by the report that the Commissioners had disagreed
and there would be no more exchanges during the
war. The next report would come from the hospital, to
the effect that a clerk in the War Department had just
been to see a friend there and told him that a boat was
up, and that the chaplains and some of the officers would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>be exchanged. And so on without end, each day bringing
some new sensation relative to the exchange question,
and each one without foundation. Upon the arrival of
any of these statements it would be followed by the
vociferous cries of “get ready,” “pack up,” “pack
up,” from all parts of the house, while the inmates would
soon gather in crowds to discuss the correctness of the
report. One would be certain of its truth, for it came
from a reliable gentleman; the next would be a little
doubtful, while the third one declared he would hardly
believe we were exchanged even if Capt. Turner should
come up himself and announce the fact.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lieut. Flick, for an attempt to bribe the guard and escape,
was taken out and confined in the cell for some
three weeks, then released and sent back among the
officers.</p>

<p class='c006'>When we first entered Libby we could exchange our
<i>greenbacks</i> for Confederate trash at the rate of two dollars
of the latter for one of the former. In a short time
they began to increase in value, until we were able to get
seven and a half Confederate for one of Federal, at which
rate it ranged for a long time. At first the exchange of
money was conducted through the sentinel stationed on
guard at the stairway, but two or three having been arrested
for so doing, put a stop to that manner of transacting
business and another, but less dangerous, plan was
adopted. One hundred dollars in greenbacks would
be raised and sent out by one of the negro boys belonging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>to the establishment, who would exchange it with
some citizen, and bring us back seven hundred and fifty
dollars in Confederate rags, which was the only kind of
currency we could use in the purchase of provisions.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following is the list of officers from our regiment
who were captured at Winchester and confined in Libby:
Col. W. T. Wilson, Lt. Col. H. B. Hunter, Adjt. Blair,
Capts. Riggs, Caldwell, Robbins, Rosenbaum, Randolph,
Bender and Chamberlin; Lieuts. Davis, Smith, Bevington,
Schuyler, Pumphrey, Breckenridge, Sowers, Colver,
Williams, Acker and Boyce, making twenty-one in all.
The enlisted men were taken to Belle Isle, confined
there about three weeks, when they were paroled and
sent North.</p>

<p class='c006'>On October 7th, the chaplains were aroused early in
the morning, marched to the boat, and then taken down
the James river to City Point, where they met the Flag
of Truce boat, and went North. They were all very
much elated, except Chaplain McCabe, of the 123d Ohio,
who, on account of poor health, was obliged to wait for
the next boat.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 11th a meeting of the Ohio and Pennsylvania
officers was held for the purpose of making the necessary
arrangements preparatory to holding our election. On
the 13th election was held. At the Pennsylvania polls
Curtin received a large majority. And at the Ohio polls
one hundred and sixty-three votes were cast—one hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>and sixty-two for Brough and one for Jewett.
Three Ohio officers refused to vote.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 16th we were notified by the Rebel authorities
that they would only furnish us twenty-five dollars—Confederate—per
month out of our money in their possession.
This amount would not have furnished potatoes
for one week, at the rate we were paying for them, but
as we were under Rebel authority, we of course, had to
submit.</p>

<p class='c006'>Furnished with only a limited supply of Government
rations, money taken from us, and only allowed in such
small sums that it really amounted to nothing, caused us
to think that perhaps they meant to starve us. Richmond
daily papers were constantly complaining about
their government feeding so many Yankees there; and one
paper advised the authorities to confiscate the boxes of
clothing and provisions that were sent us by our friends
in the North.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 19th the Right Rev. Bishop Magill (Roman
Catholic) preached to the officers in Libby. On the 20th
quite a large number of boxes, for officers, from their
friends in the North, arrived and were distributed. A
few greenbacks were ingeniously concealed in some of
the boxes and, fortunately, escaped the search of the
examing officers. Notices were posted, informing us
that there would be, hereafter, roll-call twice a day—at
7:30 A. M. and 5:00 P. M.—and that five minutes would
be allowed each time to “fall in;” officers not in line
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>then “would be punished accordingly.” Also, that if
“spitting on the floor” and “throwing apple cores in the
spit-boxes” were not stopped, the purchase of tobacco
and apples would be prohibited. We received letters
from the regiment on the 21st, being the first since we
were captured.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Rebels had some sugar in hogsheads, stored in
the ware-house, nearly opposite the Libby, where some
of our enlisted men were confined. The men were in
the second story, the sugar in the first. On the 24th it
was discovered that the sugar had been too tempting for
the boys, and that they had appropriated some seven or
eight hogsheads to their own use, amounting to some
twenty thousand dollars of their money. As a matter of
course, the remainder was immediately moved out of the
reach of the half-starved Yankees.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 25th a letter was found, purporting to be from
a Michigan surgeon to Capt. Turner, asking for a blanket,
in which he stated that, under other circumstances, he
would rather be a friend to the South than an enemy.
A drum-head court-martial was immediately convened,
the culprit brought forward, and confronted with the letter.
It appeared, on examination, that he was guilty of
writing the letter, but that he was a loyal man and, suffering
very much for the want of a blanket, had taken
this method to procure one. He was permitted to go
unmolested, as he had not succeeded in his attempt to
deceive our <i>humane</i> captors.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Maj. Huston, who had been in the hospital for some
time, and was a tailor by trade, was employed by the
Rebel surgeon to repair his uniform for him, which he
did, but, when completed, instead of giving it to the surgeon,
donned the uniform himself and, about dusk, he
quietly walked out, passing himself off as the surgeon.
He succeeded in passing the guards without any difficulty.</p>

<p class='c006'>This escape so alarmed the Rebels that they took possession
of the lower east room, again locating the officers’
hospital in that room, nailed up the door between that
and the upper rooms, giving us the possession of the
lower, middle room, after taking the precaution to nail
up the windows and double the guard on the outside of
the building. For nearly forty-eight hours after the sick
and wounded officers were brought to the building, the
Rebels neither furnished them with rations nor blankets,
but after dark, communication was opened with them,
and they were furnished with blankets by us and a portion
of our eatables.</p>

<p class='c006'>About midnight of the 25th a gun was fired by one of
the guards, at which signal—premeditated no doubt, as
no one was attempting to escape—there immediately
assembled in front of the prison two companies of infantry
and a small crowd of men with a howitzer. This was
done very promptly, no doubt with the intention of intimidating
us Yankees inside.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 26th we were put on bread and water. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>reason assigned for this was the breaking open of the
door into the hospital, but, most probably, the reason
was the want of meat to furnish us with.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the last of this month the weather was very
severe, our officers suffering much from the cold. We
were allowed little or no fire, and the windows having no
glass in them, the zephyrs had free access. Many of us
had no underclothing, a number with only one blanket,
and some without any. One morning the man “George,”
without any provocation, drew a revolver on one of the
officers, when Lieut. Reed, 3rd Ohio, a wounded officer,
told him he must not attempt that here. For this offence
(?) Reed was taken down to the cell and kept
there three days, the first night without any blanket
whatever.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 29th of October some forty boxes and bales,
from the Sanitary and Christian Commissions, were received
at Libby; also, about one hundred and fifty private
boxes, for officers. The boxes from the Sanitary
Commission were consigned to Gen. Dow, consisting of
shirts, drawers, socks, handkerchiefs, and blankets.
Those from the Christian Commission were consigned to
Lieut. Randolph, 5th U. S. Artillery, the contents consisting
of underclothing, reading matter, hams and
liquors, the latter, no doubt, for hospital purposes. The
articles were, probably, as well distributed as could be
expected under the circumstances, excepting the hams
and liquors, which were monopolized by a very few.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>On the 30th of October we learned that nine men, belonging
to our regiment, were still on Belle Isle, some of
them wounded and all suffering very much.</p>

<p class='c006'>On November 2d, some of the officers received money
from the Rebel authorities at the rate of five dollars Confederate
for one of greenbacks. A large number of private
boxes also arrived and the next day were distributed;
six for the officers of the regiment, one of them from
the sutler. So many boxes were arriving at this time that
they were examined very briefly; the principal object of
the search being to ascertain whether there was any
liquor concealed in them. Both money and lengthy letters
were frequently so ingeniously concealed as to elude
even a close scrutiny. They were usually secreted in
cans of fruit or butter, and occasionally a can of whisky
would pass labelled “peaches.”</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 5th Gen. Dow went over to “Belle Isle” and
issued to our men, confined there, the clothing consigned
to his care by our Government. He reported their condition
to be very destitute indeed, many being compelled
to sleep on the bare ground without any shelter over
them. This sort of treatment, in the dead of winter and
on a sandy island in the James river, was simply barbarous.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 7th a class in sword exercise was organized,
and for a few days nothing but the resounding clash of
<i>sticks</i>, and the various commands were heard. But the
novelty of the thing soon wore away, and this, like every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>amusement gotten up to while away our lonesome hours,
was soon dropped.</p>

<p class='c006'>Large numbers of boxes arrived daily, their contents
being distributed to the boys on “Belle Isle,” by Union
officers designated for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gen. Dow occasionally entertained us with a lecture on—his
favorite topic—Temperance. Corn bread was our
regular rations; the Rebel authorities said they had nothing
else to give us.</p>

<p class='c006'>November 8th the Rev. Dr. McCabe, of the city,
preached to us in the afternoon, and the minstrels performed
in the evening. A gun was fired by one of the
guards during the night, the alarm given and the whole
guard turned out to repel the expected outbreak, which,
after all, was only a false alarm.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 12th the daily papers stated that the surgeons
had been exchanged, whereupon everybody went to
work writing long letters to be secreted on the persons of
the fortunate doctors, and in that way get them smuggled
through the “blockade.”</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 13th several hundred enlisted men were sent to
Danville, the Rebels beginning to fear that there were
too many Yankees in and about the city of Richmond.
It did not make much difference to the boys, as they
could hardly be treated any worse than they had been.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 14th we had some beef issued to us for the first
time in many days. Corn bread was our staple, and such
stuff it was; it looked as though the meal of which it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>composed had been made by grinding the corn and the
cob together, thus utilizing the whole ear. The compound
was baked in large sheets about three feet square
and from three-fourths of an inch to three inches in
thickness, and about the solidity of lead. No one ever
attempted to dispute the fact that we received our full
rations of “bread by weight” during those days.</p>

<p class='c006'>About this time the most exciting topic of conversation
was relative to allowing Rebel ministers of the Gospel
to preach to us in Libby. It was decided, however,
to allow them to do so.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the morning of the 24th the surgeons were notified
to be ready to leave in a few moments, as the Confederate
soldiers had arrived; they were also ordered to disgorge
the letters they had concealed about their persons;
only a few of them, however, did so. We afterwards
learned that they were searched down stairs, but with
what result we did not learn.</p>

<p class='c006'>Letters were concealed about their persons in a variety
of places; in the lining of hats, coats, pants and boots,
under shoulder straps, bandaged around sore legs, twisted
up in small wads, and carried loosely in the pockets, concealed
in plugs of tobacco, loaves of bread, etc.</p>

<p class='c006'>Maj. White, 67th Pennsylvania, hired a surgeon to let
him go in his place, which he did. It being afterwards
discovered—some Federal officer having divulged the
fact—notice of it was telegraphed to City Point. The
Major was stopped, and we were notified that unless we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>designated the surgeon left behind, our rations would be
stopped. Some <i>craven-hearted coward</i> pointed him out.
The next day Major White was brought back, but was
not punished.</p>

<p class='c006'>And such was life in Libby. It was not safe to trust
any-one, save your most intimate friends and acquaintances.
Volumes might be written of the brave things
that were done in that terrible place, and then, again, of
mean and cowardly things, done by men, whom at home
were brave men and gentlemen. The only wonder is
that every spark of manhood was not utterly crushed out
of those so unfortunate as to be confined within its walls.
Modern warfare presents no parallel in the treatment of
prisoners, as devised and perpetrated by the chivalric
gentlemen who managed the affairs of the so-called “Confederacy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But enough has been told to convey some idea of our
condition while prisoners—the many hopes deferred!
the long, weary waiting, that made the heart sick nigh
unto death.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is needless to follow our officers and men to other
prisons, where many of them were sent, when our forces
got in close proximity to Richmond. It would be the
same old story, in some cases, perhaps, a little more revolting,
but in the main, one Rebel prison was a sample
of all the rest.</p>

<p class='c006'>One thing more that should be mentioned in connection
with our life in Libby: On the 6th of July, 1863,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>all the Federal captains, then in Prison, were ordered to
fall in—there were seventy-two in number. They were
then taken down stairs, into a large, vacant room in the
same building and formed in a hollow square, when Capt.
Turner read an order from Gen. Winder, directing him
to select, at once by lot, from among the Federal captains
in his custody, <i>two for immediate execution</i>! Each captains
name was then called, and, when answered, a slip
of paper, containing his name and regiment, was placed
in a box. We were then given permission to select one
of our chaplains, if we desired, to draw out two names.
We selected Father Gray, who, after offering up a prayer,
with a trembling hand and tears standing in his eyes,
drew out two slips and handed them to Captain Turner.
That moment was one of anxious suspense to those
seventy-two men who were awaiting the result. Capt.
H. W. Sawyer, 1st N. J. Cavalry, and Capt. Flinn, 51st
Indiana, were the unfortunate men. We all thought, at
that time, that they would surely be executed. They
were confined in the dungeon a few days, and, our Government
taking prompt action in the matter, by holding
Gen. Lee and Capt. Winder as hostages for our men, the
rebels soon relaxed their rigor, and permitted them to
come back with the other prisoners.</p>

<p class='c006'>The foregoing shows the exact condition of the regiment,
as exhibited by the muster-out at Columbus,
Ohio. June 12th and 13th, 1865.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>

</div>

<p class='c005'>On the night of December 9th, 1864, when the regiment
was being transported by rail from Opequan Bridge,
in the Valley, to Washington, on our way to join the
Army of the Potomac, in front of Richmond, Private
Silas Simpson, of Company C, being on a flat-car
crowded with men, laid down near the bumper, and having,
it is presumed, dropped asleep and fallen between the
cars, met with an instant death, no less than three trains
passing over his body before it was discovered that he
was missing.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the early part of our term of service, the orders
were very strict in reference to individual foraging,
and whenever complaints were made at headquarters by
some Secesh citizen, that some of the boys had been
slaughtering a beef of his, or perhaps a poor innocent
porker had gone the way of all the world, or, perchance,
a box of honey, or a loaf of bread, or a nice ham, was
not to be found, then forthwith a guard must be stationed
around his house and the mens’ quarters searched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>for the missing articles. The men generally received due
and timely notice, and the articles were buried in some tent
and a poor sick boy, that could not be moved, would be
lying over it. The officers engaged in the search, would
perhaps look in the tent and says, “Boys, is any of that
meat or honey here?” They were never known to receive
an affirmative answer. Occasionally they would be
caught in the act, as the following incident will testify:
The regiment had just gone into camp on the bank of
the Shenandoah, near Halltown, one hot day in August,
1864. The men were nearly all bathing in the river,
when they spied a field of corn on the opposite bank and
immediately went for it. Two boys of Company A, each
unadorned with any particular amount of clothing, and,
having their arms filled with roasting ears, were caught
by a cavalry guard set there to watch the corn; and without
their clothing, which was on the other side, were
marched to division headquarters; from which place
they were sent, through the <i>regular channels</i>, to regimental
headquarters, with an order to have them “tied
up by the thumbs.” From there Col. Wilson sent them
to company headquarters, with instructions to carry out
the order <i>after night</i>—the <i>particular</i> night not being
specified. Why Capt. C. had plenty of corn for dinner
is plain.</p>

<p class='c006'>After any of these depredations, should any of the
officers discover next morning in their quarters, a nice
steak, plate of honey or roll of butter, it was not deemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>necessary to institute a search to see where it came from.</p>

<p class='c006'>When we passed near Sewell Mountain, returning from
the Lynchburg Raid, June 29th, 1864, one of the men
caught a young fawn and made a present of it to the
Colonel. A “hard tack” box was rigged up, the fawn
put into it and conveyed on the back of a mule to Camp
Piatt; from there it was taken with the regiment to Martinsburg,
where it became a great favorite with the men,
and was finally sent from there to Ohio.</p>

<p class='c006'>At Winchester there were several Union families, one
of whom will always be remembered with hearts full of
gratitude for their kindness to many of our regiment.
The members of that family who resided there during the
war, consisted of an old Quaker gentleman, Mr. Sidwell,
his wife, one son—a young man—and his two daughters,
Anna and Martha. When we were captured there, on
the 15th of June, 1863, and confined in the Court House,
we were without anything to eat for thirty-six hours.
Sending a note through one of our surgeons to Mr.
Sidwell, he, in company with his wife, soon made his
appearances with a large basket of provisions, which was
certainly a rich treat to us. The next morning the
two daughters came with more supplies, and towels and
soap, which afterwards proved of great use to us in Libby.
During the whole war, from its commencement to the
close, Winchester was hardly free from the conflict of
battle for any length of time, changing hands no less
than <i>seventy-three</i> times, three times in one day. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>family remained there the whole time, unable to get
away, the two daughters making it a constant practice
every day to visit the hospitals, and endeavor to ameliorate
the condition of our sick and wounded. There are
several in the 123d who will not soon forget them and
their acts of kindness.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sir</i>:—At the request of the commanding officer of
the regiment, I have the pleasure of presenting through
you to the State of Ohio, the remnants of the colors carried
by the 123d Regiment of Ohio Volunteer Infantry
during last summer’s campaign in the Shenandoah Valley,
Virginia. They were borne through the following
engagements in Virginia: Newmarket, May 15th, 1864;

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>—Your favor of the 15th instant has been handed
me, accompanied by “what remains of the colors of the
123d Regiment.” The custody of these tattered flags is
thankfully accepted on the part of the State, and they
will be appropriately placed among other and similar
mementoes of the patriotism and courage of our soldiers
in this great struggle to sustain the Government and
unity of the country.</p>

<p class='c010'>The 123d Regiment presents a record highly honorable
to its officers and men, and ennobling to the State.
These records have given to our State the high rank she
now occupies in the annals of the war, and they constitute
one of the brightest pages in the history of this
wicked Rebellion. Thanking you for the presentation
made by the regiment,</p>

<p class='c006'>The first six months we were in the service we did a
great amount of picket duty, and for men who were
then “spoiling for a fight,” it was not generally a very
pleasant labor. Still, occasionally an incident would occur
that would vary the monotony a little. One, that a
few men will not soon forget, occurred while we were at
Petersburg. A large detail from the regiment was on
picket, and one of the captains—who had never officiated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>as “Officer of the Day”—was acting in that capacity on
this occasion. When the hour at night came for “grand
rounds” he started out on the Franklin Pike. When
nearing the post he was ordered to halt, and to “dismount
and advance one with the countersign.” He
obeyed, and with his sword drawn and at a carry, advanced
to the sentinel, whose authority he recognized by
giving the salute, with drawn sword, due to a superior
officer. Soon after, Company C was picketing on the
Moorefield road, when Gen. Milroy was returning in the
night with an escort from Moorefield, but without the
countersign. He was halted, compelled to dismount,
and, notwithstanding his assertions that “he was Gen.
Milroy,” was conducted to the “officer of the guard,”
who recognized him officially before he was permitted to
pass.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 19th of October, 1864, when Sheridan, gained
his famous victory at Cedar Creek, while the infantry
were lying down in two lines, waiting for the advance,
which was soon made, and while the enemy were throwing
solid shot just over us, an enterprising newsboy rode
up with the Baltimore <cite>American</cite> for sale. He rode along
slowly disposing of his papers, until a solid shot struck
very near his horse, when he turned his head to the rear
and rode off with the remark that “it was getting too
d—d hot for him there.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Just after we had got fairly started on our Lynchburg
raid, and when one day the men had got very tired of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>carrying their one hundred rounds of ammunition each
and were grumbling much thereat, a cavalry officer rode
by, and inquiring of one of our men, “What troops are
these?” received the reply, “Troops? Hell, this is
Gen. Hunter’s ammunition train!”</p>

<p class='c006'>When the Regiment was lying at New Creek, November,
1862, Capt. Horace Kellogg, with his company (B),
was ordered by Gen. Milroy to proceed at once to St.
George, Tucker county, Virginia, and assess and collect
enough money from disloyal citizens to reimburse the
loyal citizens of that place, who had been robbed by
guerrillas. Gen. Milroy’s order was as follows “If
they do not pay the amount you assess them, at the designated
time, you will proceed to burn their houses, seize
their property and shoot the men.” As soon as the company
arrived at St. George, Capt. Kellogg found out who
were the disloyal subjects, and proceeded to issue circulars
to them, in accordance with Milroy’s orders. It is
needless to say that the money was forthcoming. Five
thousand dollars were collected and disbursed to the Union
men who had been despoiled of their property.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>COMPANY D.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Inasmuch as Company D was away from the regiment
on detached duty for a time, it may be interesting to give
an outline of their doings while thus employed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sometime during the month of May, 1863, Company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>D was ordered to report to Gen. Milroy for duty. Capt.
Shawhan was appointed Provost Marshal, and his company
formed a part of the guard. Capt. Shawhan went to
work at once in the performance of the duties of his
office, and made a very efficient officer. He soon
had the city thoroughly cleaned, his men burning two
kilns of lime and scattering it thoroughly about, thereby
contributing greatly in arresting the contagious diseases,
that were rapidly turning the entire city into a general
hospital.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some indiscrete young ladies insisted upon coming
upon the streets wearing gloves with “Secesh” emblems
upon them, until three or four were arrested and put in
the guard house. They soon sued for peace, and ever
after there was no trouble in curbing the turbulent dispositions
of the most violent Secessionists.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the fight at Winchester, June 15th, 1865, the
company was busy guarding prisoners and getting out
ammunition for the artillery in the forts. When the retreat
commenced they had orders to follow with their
prisoners in the rear of the command. They fell in with
the first regiment they came to, the 116th O. V. I., and
when they came to where the battle was going on, that
regiment was ordered to march right on to the Potomac
river. They arrived at Orleans Station on the night of the
16th, where they drew rations. On the 18th they started
for Cumberland, and when within ten miles of that place
they received orders to march into Pennsylvania, arriving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>at “Bloody Run,” where Milroy’s command was reorganized.
They remained there until July 4th, when,
with Couch’s Division of the 6th Corps, they followed
after Lee’s retreating army, until reaching Harper’s
Ferry, when Company D was ordered to Martinsburg,
arriving there August 4th.</p>

<p class='c006'>The regiment was collected together here, with Maj.
Kellogg in command of the post, though still suffering
much from his wound.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, after serving with the regiment through the
campaign in the Valley, about the middle of March,
1865, they were selected to form a part of the corps of
sharpshooters for our division. The boys did not much
relish the idea of leaving the regiment again, but of
course they had no option in the matter, and at once
commenced learning the use of their Spencer rifles. They
did excellent service at Hatcher’s run, losing several in
killed and wounded. Again, at Fort Gregg they were
deployed in front of our brigade in making that assault,
and by their rapid and well directed firing, assisted materially
in the capture of the fort, and were complimented
by Col. Potter, our Brigade Commander, for their good
conduct. Remaining with the division until after Lee
surrendered, they then made the trip to Lynchburg.
They were then sent home and mustered out with the
regiment.</p>

<p class='c005'>In making up this record—a part of the sacrifice we
paid to suppress the Slave-holders’ Rebellion—the Muster-out
rolls have been closely followed. It is very evident
that they were by no means complete in this particular,
except, perhaps, in the case of two or three companies.

  <h2 id='XIV' class='c004'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE ESCAPE OF OFFICERS FROM PRISONS AND A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THOSE WHO DIED THERE.</span></h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c008'>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p class='c015'>In the Spring of 1864 the most of our officers who
were then in prison where changed to various prisons
throughout the South, some of them making the entire
circuit of Libby, Raleigh, Macon, Savannah, Charleston
and Columbia.</p>

<p class='c006'>Two officers escaped by means of the “streight tunnel,”
and Col. Wilson, Lieut. Col. Hunter, Capt. Chamberlin,
and two or three others were exchanged and sent
North, and, soon after, joined the regiment; while the
greater portion of the remainder made their escape from
some of the above named prisons and at different times.
All of them, in fact, save Lieut. M. H. Smith, who was
released by Gen. Sherman, on his celebrated march to
the Sea, and Captains Riggs and Bender, who died there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>from cruel treatment. And, in-as-much as the escapes
were all very similar, it will be necessary only to recount
a few of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Captain Randolph escaped from Columbia, South
Carolina, during the Summer of ’64; by floating down
the Santee river on a flat-boat, with several others, and,
after a voyage of nearly one month, reached our fleet—blockading
its mouth. On the trip they passed under
several railroad bridges guarded by soldiers, the sentinels
being in plain sight. Their plan was to float down the
river at night, using long “sweeps” to force the boat
through the water. As soon as daylight came, they
would lay by for the day, secreting their boat, as best
they could, among willows, or brush of some description.
As a matter of course, they <i>foraged</i> for their rations,
or had colored men to do it for them. Sweet potatoes
were in abundance; and, with young chickens, or
a pig from a neighboring farmyard, a very fair meal
could be gotten up.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 3d of November Lieutenants Colver and
Boyce, observing that the guards were very slack in
watching the prisoners who were permitted to go to a
wood near by for fuel, thought that the time had come
to attempt their escape; so they, in company with another
officer, resolved to try it. Getting all ready, they
walked out—as though they had given their parole—and
kept right on to the woods, and, as soon as they were
under cover, secreted themselves until after dark, when,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>taking the North Star as their guide, they struck out for
East Tennessee—distant about four hundred miles. After
having traveled six days, they suddenly came upon
some Rebel cavalry; and, while the other two were parlaying
with them, Lieut. Colver made off through the
woods and escaped. He then had three hundred miles
to travel alone, but, by the never-failing aid of the negro,
he, after traveling thirty days—or rather nights—reached
our lines at Charleston, East Tennessee, and
was soon at home in Ohio.</p>

<p class='c006'>November 26th, ’64, Capt. Rosenbaum and Lieut. T.
W. Boyce made their escape from Columbia in the same
manner that Lieut. Boyce did the time he started out
with Lieut. Colver, and their journeyings were of a similar
character. Lieut. Boyce, who had been over the
ground part of the way once before, knew about the
direction to take. They made East Tennessee their objective
point. It was in the dead of winter, and the ground was
covered with sleet and snow for the most of the way, making
very bad walking, besides not contributing greatly to the
comfort of sleeping out of doors. However, after many
narrow escapes and almost superhuman exertions, they
arrived in our lines in safety—though pretty nearly worn
out—on the 26th of December, having been just one
month on the trip.</p>

<p class='c006'>Capt. William H. Bender, of Company I was wounded
at Winchester, June 15th, ’63, and taken to Richmond,
remaining there until May 7th, ’64. From there he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>taken to Macon, Georgia, thence to Savannah, where he
was taken down with fever. He recovered, somewhat,
and was then taken to Charleston and placed under
“fire” in the city jail yard. On September 4th he was
sent to Columbia, where he was taken down with “yellow
fever.” Receiving no medical aid for twenty-four
hours after being taken sick, he died on the morning of
the 8th, a victim of Southern cruelty and neglect. He
was a good soldier, a gallant officer, and a gentleman
<i>always</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Capt. Charles H. Riggs was born at Tiffin, Ohio, in
1835. He was, therefore, at the time of his enlistment,
twenty-seven years of age. He was agent of the Cleveland
and Toledo railroad at Sandusky, a position which
he filled well and ably, being well liked by the entire
community and highly esteemed by the men of the road.
Thus, young, loved and prosperous, he left with his command
for the seat of war, alas! never to return. Always
deporting himself as a true soldier and Christian gentleman,
he possessed the esteem of his men and the confidence
of his superior officers. Cool and brave in the
hour of danger, he had none of the bravado spirit, that
courts battle in the quiet camp, or anticipates brave
deeds to be accomplished. He was taken prisoner with
his command at Winchester, June 15th, 1863.
Not of a sanguine temperament, he seemed to think
from the very first that he never again would behold the
free North or the faces of dear ones at home—which unhappy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>sentiment of course little fitted him to bear up
under the hardships, privations and diseases incident to a
prisoner of war. Early attacked with a chronic complaint—from
which he never seemed to rally—after long
months of suffering, he breathed his brave, young life
away on the 15th day of September, 1864, in the hospital
at Charleston, amid the thunderings of cannon
hurling missiles of destruction upon the doomed city,
where first the flag of treason was flung insultingly to the
breeze. Many a heart was made sad in the regiment at
the news of his death; it seemed as though a brother
had been taken from us. Groups of men upon the
company street could be seen moving listlessly along,
talking over the sad intelligence. What then must have
been the sorrow of his family at home? Poor, stricken
ones, our hearts bled for you then as we sympathize with
you now. A dutiful son, a loving brother, a brave soldier,
and a true friend—well may be said of him:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Green be the turf above thee, friend of my better days,</div>
      <div class='line'>None knew thee but to love thee, nor named thee but to praise.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Many more events and episodes of deepest interest to
us might be narrated, did space permit. Of the tiresome
marches, the sleepless nights, and the lonely picket
posts, in the dead of winter, no pen can fittingly the
story relate. No! Only in your meetings can you
even faintly outline the unwritten history of your soldier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>lives. The sufferings, the danger, and the privations so
patiently born, you yourselves can only know.</p>

<p class='c006'>By these memories so holy, by our brave ones gone,
by the defeats sustained, and victories gloriously won,
let us hope that the Union, which it was our fortunes to
help sustain and preserve, may remain unbroken forever.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
